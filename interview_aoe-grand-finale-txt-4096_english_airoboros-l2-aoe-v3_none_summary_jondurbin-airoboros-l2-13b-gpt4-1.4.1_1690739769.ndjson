This decision proved to be risky for Velez, as it left him vulnerable without a full HP scout. Despite this setback, Velez managed to steal another elephant from Yo's base, giving him two elephants in total.\n\nYo decided not to lame on the map, choosing instead to take the sheep and maintain his full HP scout. This decision allowed him to gather more resources and build up his army faster than Velez.\n\nVelez attempted a fast castle, but it was unsuccessful due to Yo's superior positioning and resource management. As a result, Yo was able to counterattack and destroy Velez's castle before it could become fully functional.\n\nThroughout the game, both players focused heavily on the gold deposits located near their bases. They also engaged in skirmishes over control of the berry bushes, which provided additional food resources.\n\nIn the end, Yo emerged victorious, defeating Velez by a narrow margin.

They mention that Yo will likely play into skirmishers and cavaliers, giving away archer sips to take cavalry sips, while playing against Velez's archer-heavy composition.\n\nThe game starts with both players starting on stone, but Velez has a slight advantage in resources due to his faster start. Yo builds up his economy quickly, focusing on Town Centers and Skirms, while Velez builds up his army with crossbows and Mangonels.\n\nVelez makes the first move by sending his crossbows to attack Yo's Town Center, which is defended by Skirms. This trade results in a loss of one Town Center for Yo. However, Velez loses several units in the process, including his Mangonel.\n\nYo responds by building more Town Centers and Skirms, as well as researching Archery. He also sends out scouts to gather information about Velez's position. Meanwhile, Velez continues to build up his army with crossbows and Mangonels, while also researching Arbalest.\n\nAs the game progresses, Velez manages to destroy one of Yo's Town Centers, leaving him with three remaining. Yo counters this by sending out his Skirms to engage Velez's crossbows, resulting in a successful trade for Yo.\n\nWith time running out, Velez decides to go for a fast imp, which would give him an immediate target against Yo's fourth Town Center. However, Yo manages to kill the Mangonel before it can fire, preventing Velez from completing the imp.\n\nIn conclusion, the game ends with Velez having lost one Town Center and most of his army, while Yo still has three Town Centers and a strong military presence.

They mention that Velez is in castle and Yo is in imp, with both players having similar resources. One player suggests that Velez could push up the middle with his Ethiopian death ball, but the other player thinks it would be risky due to Yo's forward castle on Velez's resources.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to analyzing Yo's strategy of building a forward castle on Velez's resources. Both players agree that this is typical of Yo's playstyle, as he often builds forward castles on other players' resources. However, they also point out that this particular castle is risky because Velez has an imp nearby and a crossbow army waiting for him.\n\nOne player suggests that Velez should consider buying some food and selling some wood to go up himself, while the other player recommends idle talent centers and waiting for the imp. They discuss the importance of not committing to both strategies, as it can lead to losing both the army and the imp.\n\nYo continues to build his forward castle, and Velez eventually decides to send his army back to Yo's base. However, Yo takes out more than one range and the siege workshop, forcing Velez to make another siege workshop. This causes Velez's economy to become even more fragile, which leads to questions about whether or not he should have sent his army earlier.\n\nThe conversation then turns to discussing Yo's expansion plans on the left side of his base. He is trying to expand precautionarily, knowing that Velez may be moving towards there with bloods. Meanwhile, Velez is only now getting out of bomber cannon, so Yo has time to prepare for any potential attacks.\n\nOne player suggests continuing with skirmishers but also having the option to go for light cav, as Tatars have silk armor. Another player agrees that having some light cav on the field would be beneficial.\n\nYo continues to push down Velez's TC, causing damage to various buildings such as a barracks, archer range, and TC itself. Velez had enough of this and decided to find some damage on the top side with arbalests, but where do you even go? There's a TC no matter which way you turn.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to discussing how Velez's eco looks fragile compared to Yo's, despite being in him and Yo being in castle. They attribute this to the psychological pressure caused by Yo's forward castle, which made Velez feel like he needed to break into Yo's base immediately.\n\nFinally, Velez breaks into Yo's base with his army, and they begin fighting. Yo masses scrimmages from two ranges, while Vlez comes in and has enough for a castle. The question arises: where will Velez place his castle? He chooses to place it in the bottom, which the players agree is a typical Yo castle placement.\n\nThe transcript ends with the players discussing how Yo likes to build forward castles on other players' resources, and how this particular castle is risky due to Velez's imp nearby and crossbow army waiting for him.", "params": "SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=1.176, frequency_penalty=0.0, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.1, top_k=40, use_beam_search=False, stop=[], ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, logprobs=None)", "model": "jondurbin/airoboros-l2-13b-gpt4-1.4.1", "runtime": "vllm"}

They mention that when they think Spanish, they think fast castle and Conquistadors. However, if you lose all your fish early, you won't have enough food to either go fast castle or make Conquistadors.\n\nThe context then shifts to an analysis of a game being played by Falez and Yo. Falez is playing as the Spanish and Yo is playing as the Finns. The Finnish player has a big advantage because he knows where Falez's dock is, while Falez doesn't know where Yo's dock is. This gives the Finnish player a significant edge in terms of knowledge.\n\nFalez tries to scout the shoreline with sheep to find Yo's dock, but he misses it completely. He might never see it because he scouted before the house was there, meaning the dock was being built or the villager was somewhere else. This creates an interesting situation for Falez, who knows there's a dock but may second-guess himself and not realize it's right at the start.\n\nThe commentators discuss how difficult Dark Age on New Mad is due to many unknowns, such as not knowing where bores are. They also point out that when in doubt, you always go water against Spanish anyways. Falez will most likely be going faster, so he should probably find that dock.\n\nOne positive aspect for Falez is that he won't randomly switch his dock to another point in the map since he's on the big lake. This means he'll be close to Yoh's fish regardless of whether he scouts it or not.\n\nYoh knows where the TC is for Falez, as he lost a sheep next to Falez's town center. Falez has had a few more sheep now, but he's been scouting mainly the shoreline. Despite this, he still hasn't found the dock.\n\nThe commentators discuss the strategies available to both players. For Falez, he has the choice to go wagons or not, depending on how close Yoh is to his town center. He also has the option of guard tower defense, but it has fallen out of favor recently in the meta.\n\nIn conclusion, the transcript provides a detailed analysis of a game being played between Falez and Yo, highlighting interesting gameplay events and strategies.

Falez places his first dock near his town center, while Yo builds a second dock closer to Falez's first dock. This causes Falez to rethink his position and place another dock further away from Yo's second dock.\n\nYo then sends a villager to scout Falez's base, discovering his third dock. He also finds out that Falez has a fishing ship nearby. In response, Yo uses his fishing ship to block the path between Falez's docks, preventing him from accessing the fish.\n\nFalez repairs his docks, but makes a mistake by repairing the wrong one, losing a free fire gallery in the process. Yo takes advantage of this by sending more villagers to harass Falez's base.\n\nBoth players continue to build up their armies, with Falez focusing on cavalry and Yo prioritizing infantry. They eventually reach imperial age, and the game enters a grush war phase.\n\nThroughout the game, both players make strategic decisions based on their opponent's actions. For example, when Falez discovers Yo's second dock, he realizes that he needs to place another dock further away to avoid being blocked by Yo's fishing ship.\n\nIn conclusion, the game showcases a highly competitive match between two skilled players using different strategies and adapting to each other's moves.

Hussar points out that this could be an attempt by Yo to fake out Velez, as he doesn't have the food economy to make conchs anyway.\n\nHera then mentions that Velez is about to transport three crossbows over, which will be devastating for Yo. Hussar agrees and adds that it's a small thing, but if you're doing this, it has to be four crossbows so you can two-shot villagers.\n\nThey continue discussing Velez's strategy, noting that he's forcing a lot of idle time from Yo at least, which is not too bad.

He's docked in the far south for more efficient fish and expanding to second and third town centers. This puts him ahead of Yo, who is chasing the crossbows in his base and will deal with them eventually.\n\nHussar points out that the risk for Yo would be if he had five or six Conks with a couple of Mega Elves and a forward Castle in Velez's face.

One player, Yo, is using a cavalier flood strategy while the other player, Velez, has a massive CA army.\n\nYo sends his cavalry to attack and take down a castle belonging to Velez. This causes Velez to lose some of his population, which could potentially be problematic for him in the long run. However, Yo continues his cavalier flood strategy without any sign of tech switching.\n\nVelez counters by sending out crop rotation, but it is unclear if this is worthwhile considering that Pause hasn't yet been researched. The discussion then shifts to the fact that Yo hasn't been engaging against cav archers, which could become an issue later on when Velez has 70 fully upgraded cav archers.\n\nYo eventually manages to take down another castle belonging to Velez, allowing him to send more cavalry towards the enemy base. At this point, both players agree that Yo should switch to arbalest or at least Skirmishers, as light cavalry from Velez are already present on the field.\n\nVelez, meanwhile, is concerned about getting light cavalry due to his limited food supply and the fact that he's sending everything on a wooden gold at the moment. He could potentially lose some TCs if he doesn't manage his resources carefully.\n\nYo takes advantage of this situation by sending all his cavalry to attack the main town center of Velez, which is defended only by a few cav archers. The trebuchets will also take out the town center, giving Yo control over the area.\n\nThe discussion then turns to whether or not Velez should switch into light cavalry, given his limited resources. Both players agree that it might not be worth it and suggest that he instead get heavy cavalry archers and stall the game until he can afford the hissaur afterwards.\n\nIn conclusion, the transcript highlights the strategic decisions made by both players during the final stages of the game.

They agree that he should probably go for a three TC room, defend with Mangano's, and wait for redemption to come in. This makes Mangano defense a lot worse, giving Velez an advantage.\n\nVelez counters by converting a Cab Archer into a monk, which can convert siege weapons.

Yo loses his first pig to Velez, but manages to steal back some pigs from Velez's base. However, he also loses several deer to Velez's scouting efforts.\n\nIn the early game, Yo sends forward villagers to deny Velez's docks, while Velez builds up his economy and expands his territory. Both players focus on wood production and gathering resources.\n\nAs the game progresses, Yo starts building archers and man-at-arms, while Velez continues to expand his territory and build more units.

He also loses several pigs to Velez's scouting efforts. Despite these setbacks, Yo manages to send forward villagers to deny Velez's docks again, forcing him to rebuild them.\n\nIn the late game, both players have built up significant armies and continue to fight over resources.

This forces Velez to rebuild his docks yet again, costing him valuable time and resources.\n\nThe commentators discuss the strategic significance of this move by Yo, as it not only denies Velez's docks but also forces him to spend time and resources rebuilding them. They note that this could potentially be a turning point in the game, as every minute counts on Frisia.\n\nAs the game enters the endgame, both players continue to fight over resources and build up their armies. Velez manages to take out Yo's last pig, leaving him without any additional pigs needed for a fast castle.\n\nIn the end, Velez emerges victorious, winning the tournament match.

They also point out that Velez made a sloppy move by sending a scout too close to the enemy base, but it was understandable given the pressure from Yo.\n\nYo sends villagers and archers to attack the fire galley, killing it. However, he loses a scout in the process. Velez responds by running into the fire, losing another villager, and sending a villager to kill the fire galley. Despite these losses, Velez is still in a good position due to his fully-walled base and horse-calling ability.\n\nThe players discuss an interesting strategy that Velez could use: switching off of water completely and focusing on farms. This would allow him to counter Yo's Portuguese advantage and potentially gain more food for a castle drop.\n\nAs the game progresses, Yo continues to commit to water while Velez focuses on land pressure. Yo's fishing ships are still alive against two dogs, thanks to the Portuguese bonus. Velez has four fish in the back and no other options for water units.\n\nThe players debate whether or not Yo should switch off of water entirely and focus on farms, considering his current situation.

This shows Yo's strategic thinking and how he uses his resources efficiently.\n\nVelez makes a stable choice with Japanese, which the commentators dislike because it doesn't fit well with his current strategy. However, this decision may have been made due to the lack of available options or simply as a counter to Yo's aggressive playstyle.\n\nAt T90, Yo demonstrates his excellent micro-management skills by immediately repairing his units with Vills after a demo attack.

The second player responds that Hourglass is the best way to play for Yo since he only has 35 pop space and making Light Cav doesn't feel like the strongest unit.\n\nThe conversation continues with the second player noting that Velez doesn't have any Relics, which could be why he lost two Relics by pressing on Garrison instead of Ejecting Monks.

The finals were between Yoan \"Yo\" Kouli and Vales \"Vales\" Benevolent, with Yo emerging victorious 5-1.\n\nThe first game saw both players start off strong, but it was Vales who took an early lead after pushing his sheep into Hera's base and destroying his Town Center. However, Yo managed to recover quickly and eventually pushed his own sheep into Vales' base, destroying his Town Center as well. With both players having lost their Town Centers, they transitioned into Castle Age. In the end, Yo won the game due to better micro management and more efficient use of resources.\n\nIn Game 2, Vales opted for a Feitoria strategy while Yo went for a standard Galleon rush. Despite being outnumbered, Vales managed to hold off Yo's initial attack and even counterattack, forcing Yo to switch to a different strategy. The game ended in a draw after both players ran out of time.\n\nGame 3 saw Vales once again go for a Feitoria strategy, this time with more success. He was able to build up a large army and push into Yo's base, ultimately winning the game.\n\nFor Game 4, Yo switched things up by going for a fast fire ship strategy. This proved to be effective as he was able to take down Vales' castle and win the game.\n\nIn Game 5, Vales returned to his Feitoria strategy, but this time Yo countered with a fast fire ship and monk strategy. This combination proved too much for Vales, as Yo was able to take down his castle and win the game.\n\nWith the series tied at 2-2, Game 6 saw both players revert back to their original strategies from earlier games. Vales went for a Feitoria strategy while Yo went for a fast fire ship and monk strategy. Once again, Yo's combination proved to be more effective, allowing him to take down Vales' castle and win the game.\n\nWith the series now tied at 3-3, Game 7 saw both players make some adjustments to their strategies. Vales went for a Feitoria strategy with a focus on organ guns, while Yo went for a fast fire ship and monk strategy. This time, Yo's monks were able to break through Vales' defenses and take down his castle, securing the victory and the championship title.\n\nOverall, the Resurgence Finals showcased some incredible gameplay from both Yo and Vales. While Vales demonstrated the power of the Feitoria strategy, Yo showed that a well-executed fast fire ship and monk strategy could be just as effective. Both players displayed excellent micro management skills throughout the series, making for an exciting and competitive conclusion to the tournament.", "params": "SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=1.176, frequency_penalty=0.0, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.1, top_k=40, use_beam_search=False, stop=[], ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, logprobs=None)", "model": "jondurbin/airoboros-l2-13b-gpt4-1.4.1", "runtime": "vllm"}
