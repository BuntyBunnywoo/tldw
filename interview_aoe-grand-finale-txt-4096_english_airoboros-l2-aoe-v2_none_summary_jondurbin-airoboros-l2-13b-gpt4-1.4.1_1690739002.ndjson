He proved this by winning four games in a row after losing the first three, which is not a best-of-five or best-of-seven series.\n\n2. $400 difference between losing and coming back: Losing the series 4-0 would have meant earning $400 less than if they had won all four games. This shows that even though there was a significant financial difference, Yo still chose to fight with everything he had.\n\n3. Self-belief: Yo's determination to win despite the odds demonstrates his strong self-belief and confidence in his abilities.\n\n4. ACCM's position: The commentator mentions that ACCM (the opponent) is likely to be offered many opportunities due to his skill level.\n\n5. Velez's strategy: Velez, the other player, makes the correct move by macroing towards Castle Age instead of over-making Archers. He also stops making Skirmishers because he won't find success with just them.\n\n6. Fletching mistake: The commentators point out that Velez made a small mistake by getting Fletching at T90 when he didn't have a chance to do damage. They suggest that it would have been better to save resources and click up later to pick up Fletching.\n\n7. Stone position: Both golds are rangeable by enemy army, and there's a world where if Elite Skirmishers and Siege Workshop are there, Velez might wanna tower later on.\n\n8. Selling stone: Selling stone has become a big thing in the meta these days, allowing players to get an edge in terms of attacking or defending. On Sunburn, both players sell stone.\n\n9.

This forces him to make a loop around the shoreline, which could take some time.\n3. Yoh knows where Falez's town center is, so he might be able to deduce the location of the TC as well.\n4. Falez has the choice between going wagons or not, depending on how close Yoh is to his town center.

The guard tower defense is a popular strategy among Koreans, but it doesn't work as well anymore due to the high level of skill in the game.\n2. Falez brings in a boar right before feudal age to go water, which Yo counters by going straight for conquistadors. This shows adaptability and awareness from both players.\n3. Yo finds Falez's dock early on, which prompts him to build his own dock closer to Falez's. This gives Yo an advantage in fishing income and could potentially lead to more food income if he can maintain control over the bay.\n4. Luck played a big factor in this match, with Yo naturally advancing faster to feudal age and finding Falez's dock earlier than expected.\n5. Both players will likely engage in a grush war, focusing on outposts and vision control while also struggling for fish resources.\n6. Yo uses a fishing ship to block Falez's path, showing smart thinking but ultimately loses a free fire gallery when repairing the wrong dock.\n7.

The main points are summarized below:", "answer": "\n\n1. The importance of controlling groups: Both players emphasize the importance of controlling groups, especially when making armies. They discuss how having eight control groups would be ideal for managing different angles and patrols.\n\n2. Yo's impressive opening to Feudal Age: Velez was expecting to win water against the poles, but Yo never gave him that opportunity. This shows how important it is to take advantage of your opponent's mistakes and capitalize on them.\n\n3. Late-game mistakes from Velez: Although there weren't many mistakes in the mid-game, some late-game decisions by Velez may have cost him a little bit. It could also be attributed to good play from Yo.\n\n4. Yo's castle near stone mines and gold mines: Both players agree that Yo loves having his castle near the stone mines and gold mines, which gives him an advantage in terms of resources.\n\n5. Velez's chasey style: One player suggests that Velez could have played more tightly on defense, being less chasey, but ultimately gives credit where credit is due for Yo's macro play in the late game with his military.\n\n6. What if Velez had no relics? The discussion turns to what might have happened if Velez didn't have those four relics in the middle, as well as his cav archer in position where the most forward castle is for Yo in the north. This leads to speculation about whether or not Yo would struggle without the poles bonus, allowing Velez to keep his hussar and potentially turn the tide of the game.\n\n7. Yo's perfect farm placement: Both players note that Yo has placed all of his farms around full works, and every single one is near a full work. This demonstrates the power of the poles bonus and how it can help players make efficient use of their resources.\n\nOverall, this transcript provides valuable insights into the strategies used by two professional Age of Empires II players during a tournament match.

Velez's base is better suited for a fast castle because he can easily wall in and take back deer, berries, gold, and stone.\n4. Yo's base is not as good for a fast castle because he would have to think about walling off his stone.\n5. The caster suggests that Yo should sneak a villa, full wall his base, and play some sort of sneak strategy since his opponent cannot scout what he has behind the walls.\n6.

The main points are summarized below:", "answer": "\n\n1. Yo's initial strategy: Yo starts with a strong economy and builds up his army quickly, focusing on cavalry archers (CA) and Mangudai (Mangano). He uses his siege to pick off the crossbows and siege from Velez, giving his CA an advantage over the enemy knights.\n\n2. Velez's counter-strategy: Velez sees the Mangano advantage and decides to click elite skirmishers (elite skirms), which is one of the worst feelings according to the commentators. This means that he has three town centers, but his eco is better than Yo's.\n\n3. Yo's response: Despite being down in economy, Yo responds well by building a third range and a TC on the front line. He also builds a stable for his CA.\n\n4. Velez's commitment: The commentators discuss whether Velez over or under committed to this match, considering his investment in crossbows, upgrades for units, and siege workshop. They conclude that he didn't have enough crossbows to make Yo respect him at all times, so maybe the Knights were not the right choice.\n\n5. Yo's next steps: Yo continues to build his economy and gets a second town center up, as well as a big shot there. He takes it and moves forward, forcing Velez to respect the Cab Archer presence.\n\n6. Velez's hole: The commentators point out that Velez actually had a hole in his defense, which he walling up now. However, they note that it doesn't really matter because a monastic is placed in the center, and it just has to happen every game.\n\n7. Yo's strategy after redemption: At this point, the commentators suggest that Yo should go for a three TC room, wait, defend with Mangano's, and then have as soon as possible to have redemption come in. This makes Mangano defense a lot worse.\n\n8. Velez's response: Velez hopes to defend with his own siege and use the Cab Archers elsewhere, but the second redemption comes in, making Mangano defense even more difficult. The only monk can convert siege, but he dies easily due to low health.\n\n9. Final thoughts: The commentators are impressed with Yo's response to the situation, as he was initially in big trouble but managed to turn things around. They believe that Velez may have overcommitted to this match, especially considering his investment in crossbows and elite skirms.", "params": "SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=1.176, frequency_penalty=0.0, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.1, top_k=40, use_beam_search=False, stop=[], ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, logprobs=None)", "model": "jondurbin/airoboros-l2-13b-gpt4-1.4.1", "runtime": "vllm"}

He has not lost a single fish so far in the game.\n2. Velez is keeping up well with his opponent, but he may be making some mistakes in his strategy choices. For example, he rushed the counter tower behind the wood line instead of waiting for a better opportunity to build it.\n3. The forecast at T90 will be crucial for both players. If Yo can get control of the water and forecast right outside Velez's gold, it would be a huge position advantage for him.\n4. Velez should consider taking risks in this tournament match, as his opponent cannot stop the castle from being built. However, this might not be Yo's style, who prefers to take calculated risks.\n5. Yo's repairing strategy with Vills is impressive, as he immediately starts repairing after building a tower. This shows his focus on maintaining his army's strength throughout the game.\n6. Fire galleys actually do very well against fire ships, which is something that both players should keep in mind during their battles.\n7. Although Velez placed his castle slightly further back than expected, it still allows him to control the waterway and secure the gold. It also puts him in a good position to defend against any organ gun pushes by Yo.\n8. Yo tried to snipe fish using a demo, but Velez successfully defended his fishing ships without losing any.\n9. Velez made an interesting stable choice by going with Japanese units, which are known for their high damage output.

He also has a tech switch on his cards, allowing him to switch between technologies quickly.\n   - His opponent, Velez, is playing as the Monks and has converted some of Yoh's organs into monks. However, he lacks the necessary military power to push back Yoh's advances.\n   - Despite losing Nomad, which is considered his best map, Yoh continues to barge into Velez's base, taking everything with him.\n   - Velez tries to convert more knights and organs but still has no way to get the siege.\n   - Yoh loses one of his castles but continues to make backup castles in his base.\n2. Velez's strategy:\n   - Velez tries to convert more knights and organs, hoping that this will give him an edge against Yoh's overwhelming military force.\n   - He also makes Pikeman, Cara, and Monk units, which could potentially stall out the game if he can get enough gold for them.\n   - However, even with these strategies, Velez still lacks the necessary military power to push back Yoh's advances effectively.\n3. Interesting gameplay events and strategies:\n   - The discussion between the two players highlights the importance of having a strong economy and effective military force in Age of Empires II.\n   - Yoh's use of Feitorias allows him to have infinite resources without needing to worry about villager management, giving him a significant advantage over Velez.\n   - Velez's attempt to convert more knights and organs shows that he recognizes the importance of converting enemy units, but it ultimately doesn't help him overcome Yoh's superior military might.\n   - The discussion also touches upon the debate surrounding the effectiveness of Feitorias, with both players agreeing that they are not a math problem but rather a practical solution for resource gathering.\n   - Finally, the transcript provides insight into how professional players analyze and discuss their opponents' strategies during tournament matches, demonstrating their deep understanding of the game mechanics and strategic thinking.", "params": "SamplingParams(n=1, best_of=1, presence_penalty=1.176, frequency_penalty=0.0, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.1, top_k=40, use_beam_search=False, stop=[], ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, logprobs=None)", "model": "jondurbin/airoboros-l2-13b-gpt4-1.4.1", "runtime": "vllm"}
