He suggests that consciousness might be a fundamental principle of matter that doesn't emerge on the basis of information processing. However, he also acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding this hypothesis.\n\nHarris discusses the difficulty in differentiating a mere failure of memory from a genuine interruption in consciousness, using the analogy of general anesthesia. He explains that while one can disrupt speech processing and clearly identify the interruption, the same cannot be said for consciousness. This leads him to remain agnostic about the panpsychism vs physicalism debate.\n\nWhen asked to bet on one camp or the other, Harris admits to being in coin toss mode due to his lack of knowledge on how the universe would be different if panpsychism were true. He mentions Bertrand Russell and others who have proposed similar ideas, but ultimately concludes that our concepts for dividing consciousness and matter may in fact be part of our problem.\n\nIn a tangent, Fridman brings up Ernest Becker's view that death could be the very thing that creates consciousness. Harris responds by defining consciousness as the fact that the lights are on at all, meaning there's an experiential quality to anything. He explains that much of the processing happening in our brains seems to be happening in the dark, without an associated qualitative sense.

Terence McKenna was a big proponent of DMT, considering it the center of his psychedelic exploration. According to McKenna, DMT experiences involve feeling unchanged while being catapulted into a different circumstance where one finds oneself in relationship to other entities. These entities are not necessarily part of one's mind.\n\nHarris also discusses lucid dreaming, stating that it allows individuals to have the best of both circumstances - the ability to explore systematically while still maintaining a connection to reality. He mentions that language constrains us, grounds us, and other things of the waking world do the same. However, when one steps outside these constraints during dreaming or psychedelic experiences, they may find the full capacity of their cognition. \n\nLastly, Harris brings up the topic of math, stating that there's no psychological continuity with one's life such that they wouldn't be surprised to be in the presence of someone who should be dead or unlikely to have met by normal channels.

However, lucid dreaming shows that the mind isn't capable of everything it might seem to be capable of even in that space. One aspect of this limitation is that all light switches in dreams are dimmer switches, meaning that visual imagery cannot be produced instantly on demand. Harris also notes that text in dreams changes when looked at and then looked back at, indicating a chronic instability of graphical imagery in dreams.\n\nFridman brings up the topic of doing math on LSD, stating that it completely destroys one's ability to do math well. This is believed to be due to LSD's effect of completely disrupting the ability to visualize geometric things in a stable way, a crucial aspect of proofs in mathematics.

Harris asserts that while a biological brain may not be necessary for intelligence, it could potentially create a conscious mind that is miserable. He argues that this would be worse than creating a person who is miserable because they would be even more sensitive to suffering.\n\nHarris then discusses the concept of free will, stating that most people believe they have it but that what they actually mean by it is unclear. He suggests that Dan Dennett, a well-known philosopher, might disagree with his understanding of free will. However, Harris has a keen sense of what people typically mean when they talk about free will, having discussed this topic extensively over the years and witnessed firsthand the confusion and emotional turmoil it can cause.\n\nAccording to Harris, free will involves a sense of self, or a feeling of being an agent appropriating experiences. There's a protagonist in the movie of one's life, and it's not just the movie, but also the viewer. People don't feel truly identical to their bodies down to their toes; they feel like they have bodies and a mind in those bodies. This duality is paradoxical, but it's something that many people experience.\n\nHarris also discusses the practice of meditation, explaining how beginners often start by paying attention to an object like the breath. They feel something vague when they first close their eyes and start paying attention to the breath, then they think about why they're paying attention to the breath. This thought process distracts them from actually paying attention to the breath. This starting point of feeling like an agent, likely in one's head, is the default starting point of selfhood and subjectivity. Married to this sense of agency is the belief that one can decide what to do next.\n\nFinally, Harris addresses the concept of free will in relation to hearing sounds.

He argues that this understanding undermines the notion of free will as something inherently personal or individual.\n\nHarris further discusses the illusion of self, suggesting that our sense of identification with thoughts, intentions, and feelings is born out of not paying close attention to what it's like to be oneself. According to him, this can be unraveled through meditation or conceptually by realizing that one didn't make oneself, one's genes, one's brain, or the environmental influences that shaped one's life. \n\nHarris also introduces the idea of culture as an operating system, likening human civilization to a distributed computation system where thoughts and ideas generate interactions and experiences. However, he cautions against viewing this process as being driven by individual nodes in the system (humans), instead suggesting that the main organisms here are the thoughts themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, Harris reiterates that much of our mind answers to this kind of description, being largely shaped by culture and genes, and not self-generated.

This distinction lies in the fact that the latter is associated with intentions and has efferent motor copy, which allows for predictions and errors to be noticed. As an example, Harris mentions reaching for a bottle; if his hand were to pass through it because it's a hologram, he would be surprised. In contrast, with a tremor, such surprise would not occur. Harris concludes by stating that while the node in the distributed computing system may feel like it is making a choice, this feeling does not give rise to the conundrum of free will.

He argues that this notion of free will cannot be reconciled with any plausible picture of causation.\n\nHarris uses the example of a distributed computing system to illustrate his point. Even if this system is either fully deterministic or admits of some random influence, it still does not allow for the kind of free will people typically ascribe to themselves. In either case, the system operates on pre-determined rules and inputs, making the idea of conscious choice without deterministic influence impossible.\n\nHarris further explains his position by referencing regretful actions or instances where someone feels another person is responsible for their actions. In these scenarios, there's a sense that the action could have been avoided or done differently. However, according to Harris, this belief contradicts the deterministic nature of the universe. \n\nTo illustrate his point, Harris imagines arranging the universe exactly as it was a moment ago, yet expecting it to play out differently. He argues that randomness alone cannot provide the sense of authorship that people associate with free will. \n\nLex Fridman then proposes an alternative view, suggesting that simple rules can create complex systems that appear to have emerged from nowhere. He mentions cellular automata as an example. However, Harris counters that these systems still operate within predetermined rules and initial conditions, which do not allow for true free will.\n\nFinally, Harris concludes that if he's wrong about his intuition about free will, and someone proves otherwise, the proof would have to be so comprehensive that it explains how conscious experience could arise from a chain of physical events without being determined by them.

Harris also discusses Stuart Russell's cartoon plan for ensuring AI alignment, which involves tethering the AI's utility function to our own estimation of what improves our wellbeing.", "context": "\n1.

Harris expresses his belief that if we are building something more intelligent than ourselves, it is inevitable that they will exceed our own horizons of value and cognition. He uses the example of birds, stating that if they could think about their relationship to humans, they would understand that there is something we care about more than them - a factor which often results in their death.\n\nFridman counters this view, arguing that he believes the trajectory of successful AI development will be positive. He asserts that these systems will need to be deeply integrated with human society in order to succeed, and therefore any intelligence explosion is likely to occur over a period of decades rather than overnight.\n\nHarris responds by drawing an analogy from recent successes like AlphaGo or AlphaZero, which were able to achieve superior chess-playing capabilities within a matter of hours. He suggests that if we can build machines that quickly outperform humans and then outperform the last algorithm that outperformed the humans, we could potentially see a rapid intelligence explosion.", "context": "\n1.

This integration will require a level of safety, or switches, as humans continue to play a significant role in strategic actions. As an example, Fridman brings up self-driving cars, noting that while we've made progress, total progress would be amazing and could potentially cancel out 40,000 deaths every year based on ape-driven cars.

He argues that most systems as they develop and become much more intelligent will be surprising, like the engineering of viruses using machine learning or the engineering of vaccines using machine learning. Lex Fridman also mentions the engineering of pathogens using machine learning for research purposes as an example. He expresses his fear about these developments but hopes that there will be a closed loop supervision of humans before AI becomes super intelligent. Sam Harris adds to the discussion by bringing up the possibility of reckless people flipping switches without fully understanding the consequences, citing the Large Hadron Collider experiment and the Trinity test as examples. He also mentions James Watson's book \"The Double Helix\" which highlights how human competition can drive scientific breakthroughs, even if it comes at the expense of others.

He believes that these traditional sets of norms and beliefs have so much downside to the unscientific bits and it's clear how we could have a rational conversation about the good stuff without needing to believe in certain aspects such as Jesus being born of a virgin or raising the dead. Harris argues that we should be far more iconoclastic than Jordan Peterson wants to be.\n\nHarris also discusses the power of stories and myths, stating that they are part of our lives and can facilitate the best possible lives. However, he maintains that we never really need to deceive ourselves or our children about what we have every reason to believe is true in order to get at the good stuff. He does not feel the need personally and does not think billions of other people need to do so either.\n\nIn response to the cynical counter argument that billions of people need to believe in odious Pamplum due to lack of education and opportunities, Harris asserts that there is no substitute for this now and it's an empirical question whether given a different set of norms and stories, people would behave more aligned than they are now.", "context": "\n1.

He also discusses the uncertainty in biology and the need for openness and trust in what's real.\n\nHarris agrees with Fridman's assessment, adding that much of scientific understanding is probabilistic and not always definitive. He uses the example of a friend claiming to read minds to illustrate this point, stating that while it's interesting, he wouldn't spend his time trying to prove or disprove such a claim until there's concrete evidence.\n\nFridman then transitions to discussing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with John Donahue, highlighting his open-mindedness and innovative approach to the sport. Donahue's focus on using the entire body for submissions, rather than just the upper half, has revolutionized the way grappling is taught and practiced.

He explains that in Jiu-Jitsu, there is no room for bullshit as each increment of knowledge can be doled out quickly and effectively. The difference between knowing what's going on and what to do and not knowing it is as wide as it is in anything in human life, but this gap can be spanned so quickly.\n\nHarris also discusses the importance of taping out when one is overpowered or outmatched, which he believes should also apply to debates and discussions about various topics. He laments the fact that many people do not tap out even when they are clearly wrong or their views have been disconfirmed emphatically. Instead, they double down on their beliefs, leading to zombie worldviews that continue to persist despite being disproven.\n\nHarris contrasts this with science, which he sees as a lot like Jiu-Jitsu. When a thesis is falsified in science, it leads to a real consensus. This process cancels any role of luck, ensuring that the outcome is based solely on skill and understanding.

Lex Fridman expresses his fascination with the way Jiu-Jitsu solves problems within its frame, but acknowledges that it may not be as effective when applied to other scenarios such as MMA or self-defense situations involving weapons. Sam Harris agrees, adding that there are instances where people who practice Jiu-Jitsu believe they can win the UFC solely by using Jiu-Jitsu techniques, which often leads to them getting punched in the face.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to the topic of martial arts frauds and delusions. Sam Harris shares an example of a famous case where a master claimed to have magic powers and issued a challenge to the world. When someone finally accepted the challenge and punched him in the face, it became clear that he had believed his own publicity at some point. This serves as a reminder that nothing should be surprising in light of the human nature on display, including the work that cognitive bias does for people.\n\nLex Fridman then asks about the role of love in Sam Harris' life or a life well-lived. In response, Sam Harris defines love as a deep commitment to the wellbeing of those we love. He explains that this means wanting the other person to be happy and even wanting to be made happy by their happiness. He also emphasizes that love cannot be zero sum in any important sense for it to actually be manifest.\n\nFinally, Lex Fridman shares his view of love, likening it to the huddling of two penguins for warmth in March of the Penguins.
