{"text": " Uh, welcome guys, this is game one between yo and veliz and we've got yo and red playing guitars and a veliz in blue as the ethiopians Denani i've been practicing my intros bro. I'm I feel like i'm smurfing it to be honest All right. Well, not bad dude. Not bad. Uh, i've seen a lot of laming on this map here So before we you know talk about some of these other things look at this velez Coming forward. He did this against his opponent yesterday And he is going to take the elephant Right back to his base Dude, I think though like while it looks good like he takes an elephant. I almost think oh he takes it. What? Wow Why was there a three hp did it start going back? Because that was weird to me that he went back to get two more hits Yeah, so what happened there is like he hit it only once he thought he hit it twice at first He hit it only once then he had to go back and get two more hits. Yeah, that's that's how it works nowadays Yeah, and I was just gonna say I don't even think it's worth it to lay him on this map because your opponent Still has two bores here. Yeah, I agree Yeah, yeah, I said the same thing yesterday But as I was saying that velez still won and then also jordan still won So I was like, what do I know? Because both of these guys are doing it But it's especially bad now to have that low hp scout means you can't even comfortably Move around their base to see how many they have on wood Or how many they have on certain resources. So that's uh something yo will obviously Not know at this point And he might still choose to decide to just steal this one back if he senses the other one was stolen But so far he's just letting it let it chill out there That means that yo guarantee thinks that it's not worth laming on this map because you definitely take that elephant There's no one around you know, you you probably know you got lamed. Yeah, you have to assume so It would it would seem as if yo is very comfortable and he's just gonna take the sheep He's very comfortable not actually laming the elephant He wants his full hp scout and I definitely think that has a lot of advantages to it But these on three hp one hit away from losing a scout really dangerous I think part of it too for yo is he's tatars. So you get 50 more food on your sheep Yeah, maybe he would have considered stealing one back there if he wasn't tatars, but I think with two elephants, which is 800 food plus The extra food on the sheep. I think he kind of makes up for it. Actually, I'm not gonna do the math I know our viewers are gonna do the math because we're gonna be bad at that But I think it actually makes up the difference or is lose very close to it It's at least enough to get started I mean like a lot of a lot of them You know a lot of the part about early laming is just simply about getting a better feudal age But if you're able to survive in feudal age, you're gonna be totally totally fine I think what's interesting is believes might actually try to fast castle being etiopians and having four boars I would say that's the only way I can see it being yeah a huge difference is if he lands a fast castle I just don't know if that's good on this map Yeah, I think it's going to be risky. Now. What is good for velez here is he sees the uh, Oh, oh Okay, I thought that yo was going to chase down the scout and he still might but he at least sees the gold A big focus on this map has not really been the berries because there's berries on either side But it's been the gold and yeah yo realizes that scout is weak. Oh, man This is gonna I don't know if he can make it back here hero, but this is Already something velez is regretting i'm sure dude running through the forest is so scary I think he should be fine. But yeah, that's it's just like now that yo knows about that, you know He knows the situation perfectly. He's obviously done an elephant, but he knows that he's going to be able to win any feudal age engagement here um I just wonder how velez is going to play this one actually being down Being down that hp because you can't really man an arm rush That's the worst thing to do when you don't have a scout in my opinion. Yeah yeah, can't block villagers, so yeah, can't block villagers and Also Your opponent is going to be able to to prep with walls because they can confidently move their scout in where they need it to be In theory obviously he's going to go for the mill here. I was thinking maybe There's a world where he could have gone for the mining camp as his second building I've seen that occasionally from some of the players who are going fast up archers and he's got 600 food underneath his tc Right now and he's about to click up the feudal. He doesn't even need that much food for archers Like that's what i'm saying like it feels like a waste day like I just gave him back the hp on my scout Yeah, okay to rot basically Yeah, it's such an interesting thing though Because like we've talked about laming I feel like it's been like the hot topic around tournaments for a long time We thought about banning it but in these days with the maps that are coming out It almost feels like laming sometimes is strong and sometimes isn't worth it Yeah players need to make that distinction. I think yeah, I think as long as the balance is there right as long as the The way the map is situated as the scout will finally go down for velez Okay, well, oh another chase scene. Okay. Yeah another chase scene as we talk Um, I think I think laming is fine That's my opinion as long as the map isn't completely brutal and everything's you know, spawning on the front et cetera, et cetera But here goes yo, he's on the way up It will be faster for velez But good job from velez to at least get decent scouting and he scouted where the gold was he scouted the barracks So that's not something I I would have expected him to get away with with a scout on three hp Yeah, he definitely needs some credit there because he he was really threading the needle there with what he could get away with And it seems like he will actually get away with it back to the tc you have to be a little bit careful here moves aside last second love how velez is setting up his map actually, um left the One, you know one area for the for the range in the front and he's gonna be completely securing that gold which is That's that's as good as it gets really. I mean that's that's perfect. I was there Well, yo built his barracks in the south. So now he can't really see what's going on in the north This is what's awkward about this map and velez can so velez just passed right through his own base Is heading over to see where yo will place his range and I think the correct move for yo Is to make the range in the north, but he's not even taking gold to your hara So now i'm not even thinking I mean, I think range opening into skyrms could be an idea for yo, but I'm not 100 on that right now Yeah, it's basically 50 50 between scouts and skyrms based on what he wants to do But it's going to be skyrms in the end up against the opens two ranges. That's interesting I would not have expected that two ranges also walls in the south are going to protect his berries against range units could be a bit of a concern of course, but I'm just I still feel like if I were to have been in velez's shoes I would have lost my scout already and i'd be going blind and the fact that He now sees the range and he knows that yo is probably opening skyrms because yo is not on gold It's just insane to me. It's he's operating as if he has a full hb scout right now Yep, and in fact even begging yo in takes the spearmint hit Feliz is playing so well there with that scout And and now he's going to be pushing in he's not going to be able to accomplish too much here But I do like the fact that he's kind of Going forward just to see what's happening He sees the double range sees the production and finally that scout goes down here for yo I can sense him getting a little agitated with that guy as time went on. Honestly Yeah, I mean yo, uh He's got he's got the mentality to get past a lot not that that's the biggest thing But after being down three games versus accm I just kind of assumed that it wasn't yo's day yesterday. It was just like, okay This sucks, you know yo is a big name, but you know There's no way he's gonna fight back four games. Whatever and that's exactly what he did. So dude as a player that kind of Struggles with like that kind of mentality I I would say like I don't have the mental strength to come back in a lot of these series seeing that it's just so like Like oh borderline inspirational. I don't want to get cheesy on you, but That's actually sick like to come back four games Also, I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way and players might not even view it this way but If it was like a hundred thousand dollar tournament Land or something, you know, then you you kind of expect the most fight um, but you know, there was a four hundred dollar difference between Losing that series four oh and coming back and winning four games in a row. That's a lot of money don't get me wrong, but like yo still said Who cares? I'm gonna go for it And uh, I think a lot of players could have just rolled over and just enjoyed the rest of their evening It was like a four hour set because he came back He he really had self-belief Yeah, I actually think yo's the kind of guy to try the same like just as hard if it's a ranked game Yeah, like a tournament or uh, like a hundred thousand dollars from a ten thousand ten thousand dollar tournament He's trying like just as hard to win every set. Yep, which is great. That's why he's in his position You know, he doesn't he doesn't give up no matter the circumstances of situations But yeah, I definitely get your point there and I love to see that fight nonetheless Yeah at the same time if accm is listening feel for you, dude We feel for you, but obviously a lot of opportunities coming for him. So Uh, okay. So very little investment from velez after seeing the double range He stayed on one range And he's clearly trying to macro his way towards castle age here And I I think this is the correct move if he were to over make archers It would be going into skyrms and wouldn't find a lot of success right now And I also think it's the correct move for yo to stop making skyrms Because he's not going to break through walls with just skirmishers Yep. Yep save the resources get the castle age and then make scrums again If you if you know, if that's the unit you want to commit to definitely makes a lot of sense I will say the one mistake from velez that I I really don't like is the fact that he got fletching You know at what point t90 that he actually have a chance to do damage. I feel like That was definitely just a waste of resources Better to save that click up and then pick up fletching afterwards a little bit sharper there, but it's okay small mistake there Yeah, and you know The timing is going to be huge on this map due to the stone positions and I was just or gold position Sorry and the reason I said stone is because the less is selling his stone and that could be a talking point here because Both golds are rangeable by enemy army And there's a world where if elite skirm and siege is there he might want to tower later on I feel like selling stone has become such a big thing in the meta these days not only on like, you know A raid bit but also on these maps here we have it on sunburn And it just allows you to get that little edge in terms of like, you know It's it's the difference between you attacking or you're defending a lot of cases here And it feels like now with the second range It's almost definitely going to be archers and manganos from vales here. Yep But I mean that time window is huge here crossbow and bodkin does research or crossbow Sorry research is faster than the lead skirm And if you can just get the siege workshop up Which hold on yo is gonna did yo Does yo know that his opponent sold stone is he in vales's head right here? Wait, does he have a market? He doesn't have a market so he'd have no way to know for sure It's it's definitely just a guess if that's what he thought But it's possible but he needs his skyrms there because otherwise he could lose his villagers But I think he can complete that tower. That's actually so sick That's super intelligent by the way because I I want to ask him if there's ever an interview in this case You know, did you know that your opponent sold stone and that's why you went for that forward tower? Yeah Usually you just counter tower and it's fine. But now vales has pushed up gold Yeah, and it's just like the timing of it too. It's like, okay, he must not have stone But he's gonna be faster than me this this is as if he's listening to us clearly He's not just be clear, you know that one that one person who's gonna be like, oh, yeah Yeah, yeah, like I heard t9. He said that yo is shooting during the tournament, you know Yeah Oh man that that sucks for vales But he does receive plus 100 food and plus 100 gold being ethiopians and he is going to take the other goal on the other side So that's a good job for vales to not engage against that I feel And he still should be okay Dude, this is like a mega smart move from mr Yo, I would have never thought of that myself and right right now it went from vales having the map control In early castle age to now it's complete control for yo, but vales is still contesting He's going for a counter attack guys He doesn't want to give it up that easily and yo actually has a hole and an exposed gold mine So this is very very risky here. Oh true. Yeah, I think yo is expecting vales to just be sitting back and so oh man, this is like I feel like what we're witnessing from yo is what happens to me every other game really good play like Oh, yeah, I cast a thousand games. I'm a beast and then suddenly big error and oh man Oh, jeez, this hurts. This is gonna come down to reaction. Okay. He's reacting properly now He's pulling all the votes at the town center He needs to get his scrums back and you know what this could actually be really bad for vales if he's not careful here Yeah, true and there's no ballistics, right? And now vales is only way to escape Uh, he needs to try and shoot through the palisade walls But the only way to escape if he doesn't go through a new hole is back where he came from and here comes yo Breaking on the other side He knows how dangerous his situation is yo is gonna chase him with the scrums and vales has to run away here But he's gonna take some losses for sure. Yep That's a little unfortunate for yo, I guess that he wasn't able to trap the entire army But he is going to be able to track this down. He doesn't have armor at all He doesn't even have fuel age armor on the scrums though. So vales could in theory focus this all down And the game will continue pretty even one here. Here. Uh, obviously Uh vales has to prep for what could be a siege push for yo on the front I think the big the big thing here is that you know when all said and done with this whole like crossbow counter attack Mr Yo has that hill in front of vales's base and it feels like he's not even in a rush to push He's even getting a market down kind of just chilling. He wants that hill And he wants to push at his time only now getting a manganal out pretty cool Yeah, but but I think if you were to talk about ideal situation from ethiopians, it would be Having killed something at this stage in early castle age Um, yeah fast ballistics siege in the middle of the map, you know This is definitely benefiting. Yo more as he's even adding the second tc because he has had the stone income and whatnot. So Pressure's on for vales to do damage here Definitely and and the reason why ethiopians are a little bit out of time or not that much But it's just that their eco bonus comes at power spikes guys So if they're not making use of that early castage power spike as t90 was saying They really they really don't get too much in castage, which the towers are definitely scaling a little bit better here in this matchup Uh, it looks like it's gonna be maggot crossbow. There's maggot skirm here big hill but on the front Yeah, and this this will come down to micro uh both with the skirmz and the crossbows because Those crossbows could even kill the skirmz. And so we have a one for one. That's even I think y'all will take that as long as he keeps this Keeps the numbers close. Oh, man Really risky there. She's getting a ram out by the way. Not sure if I grew that ram don't like it. Yeah Yeah, I mean, okay taking out the range is is fine I guess And I don't even think vales was producing out of that range and now vales has a siege weapon In the middle of the map that you can't contest Yeah, a little awkward he's getting a lot more freedom than he should have uh in this case And oh, I think vales is going for a fast imp here. Look at his resources If you're not having town centers, that's the way to work, you know, that's that's where you want to work, too Yeah, I guess what's weird is If he were to click up now would take three more minutes Uh, he's not going to click up for probably two to three more minutes max That's a long time for yo to work with town centers and being tatars. He's going to have three He's pretty well protected here His ram did actually take out the range. So I guess it was good for something Yep, decent value there And we called it here before the series we said yo would try and play into skirmishers and cav a lot we obviously haven't seen the cav here, but uh We called it here. Les loves his archers Definitely felt like that was like part of the game plan even from the draft just to give it Give away the archer sips take the calf sips and then kind of play the style to try to counter the uh The the archer the archer play and I would I really like about this style from yo Is that most people would say that crossbows are the meta right now? And and most most games definitely tend to play out with crossbows and yo says that there's definitely answers And that's what makes age one prize, too. It's such a great game in life and then Yeah, I just don't see. Okay, the fourth tc is a little worrying Because that would be an immediate target against a fast m yeah, um, I uh I have to have faith in yo though because this is kind of along the same lines of what he started to do against accm He would take control with counter units. He would boom and then he'd have a much stronger economy in the later stages So i'm not sure if you agree with me But like I would say there's two counters to the fast imp as we see big mangano shot there But yo actually kills the mangano. That's definitely a good trade from him. Yeah, I'm not sure if you agree with me I think that there's two counters to the fast imp There's either all in castles where you're playing with a lot of military Or you kind of like get a castle up and just turtle till you're in Yeah, would you prefer in this situation? Well considering yo is on stone. I think the castle is likely What is good for yo? Is if like velez is only going to push in one spot And velez pretty clearly has to push in the north So if yo ever has to flee for more resources, it's not like arabia where you've got two or three golds like you can go To other areas for golds like velez did earlier so I think It just comes down to where's the castle going to be for yo in the north And how much army is velez going to have? Yo is always going to have the opportunity to flee but yo needs to start taking some trades versus crossbows ideally Yep, let me see one one four on the mangano trades as well That's going to be pretty fine. I guess no one really is a big winner in that case The composition is going to be crossbows It's going to be arabless and probably bomber cannons since velez has no no way to get a castle up Um, it's not a bad composition, but I do feel like bomber cannons push slower than traps And I think that's the big thing here. I think I think yo is really far away from ever imping though Keep in mind. He didn't research a single armor upgrade in his skyrms, which is normally a must um So he would need double armor on his skyrms Then he's going to need 900 food to go in uh, he doesn't have the castle yet and in a minute velez is maybe going to have arabless so I think as there's a big shot there for velez I I think that Velez could do this and push right up the gut with the ethiopian death ball Yep, and we're actually you see your score is a one for zero trade with the mangano there and it gets the conversion actually six play there Not too bad small wins there Okay, y'all might place the castle here shortly and we're 30 seconds away from the upgrades being clicked for velez Let's see. Oh, is y'all gonna go forward with it? Oh, that's so risky. Oh, he wants to control the gold but that's just making it like fodder for the bomber cannons almost That's a very yo castle I would say he likes to build forward castles on people's resources but uh Now he's gonna see that velez is an imp and he's gonna see the crossbow army I think maybe you just buy some food and sell some wood here and just try and go up yourself But it's so tricky. I've been in this spot so many times. Sometimes I just want to spam skyrms and stay in castle And then other times as a great micro from yo again Uh, I choose to just idle tcs Yeah, I think the important thing guys is like don't Don't commit to like both strategies. You can't like make army and then also save for imp if you're saving for imp You idle your talent centers You don't make any upgrades and you just wait till imp because it's such a big timer on that one And in this case we see yo doing just that and you know what it's three minutes and velez is going back with his army I don't think he's gonna find too much damage here. Yeah, and I mean yo is still on stone Also, yo has just been really annoying. He took out more than one range He's now taking out the siege workshop. So velez is gonna have to make another siege workshop and Velez is at The limit right now And the fact that he is so fearful of one manganel tells the whole story I think he really needs to be sending his army to yo's base and looking for damage, but he's not Yep. Yep, and yo is trying to expand on that left hand side as well kind of just precautionary He doesn't know that velez is moving towards there with our abilities But yeah, just trying to expand a little bit here keep his eco smooth and running He's two minutes away from your peelage now and velez is only now going to be getting out a bomber cannon. So Yeah I like the idea of continuing with skirmish at this point But you will have the economy to also go for light cav and I think with the um With the tatars having silk armor, it's definitely going to be something in the back of yo's mind I might not come to that. It could just be full skirmisher, but having some light cav on the field would be fantastic She was even just trying to ram down the tc right now. Like there's been no resistance there for velez. It's insane Like we were questioning it when it came out. It got so much value Yeah, right a barracks and archery range and now like literally pushing it onto tc But of course it's dealt with now velez had enough of that one and velez is trying to find some damage on the top side with the arblest But where do you even go? You're looking at the tc no matter where you turn. Yeah But I would have preferred like if he had his manganel attacking a town center with the arbs over the last two minutes He'd be close to taking one out at this point So coming home. I think was just out of just the anxiety of the situation there for velez And I just keep looking back at velez's eco. Yes, he does have a bomber cannon, but his eco looks so fragile It's like I know he's an imp and yo is in castle But it feels like it's the other way around with how bad the economies are Yeah, and it feels like that forecast did way more Uh psychological fresher than it probably should have yeah, velez really respected it As he said going back to the army kind of bought yo some time finally we see him breaking it on the front here Yo is massing skirmishes from those two ranges volistics coming in and he has enough for a castle Where's he gonna be placed in the bottom? Interesting. Yeah, that's that's such a yo castle He's just let me control another stone. Let me control another resource. He's actually repairing his his other castle right now And here comes the army for velez again, could this have been in here faster? That's a question we asked Very similar to earlier where he's trapped But arms can take out the maganel if velez is reacting and a big moment for yo Oh my god Big shots. Yeah, he killed the maganel as well and the scrims are gonna clean the house here He does have ballistics. Veliz has no place to run. That is a big cleanup for yo Now what velez does have is he has the bomber cannons and titars don't get that So this is uh, but there's there's still some potential But yo's gonna get his castle up on the stone Velez is gonna possibly lose a lot of villagers there and he does react nicely props to him Yo, just has to survive this next wave and he's gonna take game one Yeah, so so the big thing here is that like what I will say for velez guys is that bomber cannons snowball very hard like if you have five bomber cannons Oftentimes you're just killing a building after building And they don't take as much time to unpack and repack like trebs. They're a lot more efficient at pushing forward So that's like his last chance here to kind of create a snowball and continue pushing forward And it's up to yo to kind of slow down the pace and just wait for this economy Just takes the better of velez Yeah, and I mean yo is gonna make a treble on the other side, which I like just just be as frustrating as possible But those skirms man, I mean even though they did just get some big pickups with four bomber cannons He could lose them all in one shot. So he's yep He's gonna use his uh experience here and I think half the time he's not even going to be able to attack the arms But he's just gonna make the bomber cannon stop and fire Yeah, like here. I am here. I'm not here. I am constantly That's all it is just like buying that time and yo is he gonna treble on the top of dude? This is crazy. Like he's literally just trying to attack bro The way yo sees the game is just so amazing. I love it Dude, like no one would think to do that and like all of a sudden you might even think like oh, oh big shot with a bomber Can't yeah, I think that treble is gonna be, you know waste because it's gonna go down but that's buying time. Yeah, it is But i'm a little concerned right now for yo because i'm seeing the first armor upgrade come in He hasn't researched silk armor. He doesn't have a lot of stables. So if he wants to go light cav It's gonna take some time here and the 31 on food. A lot of that is right behind velez's push so I I mean Yo could still lose this game velez has a slight chance still yep Definitely agree. And like I said, it's all about that snowball So yo is buying some time in the top, but velez is not really biting his heart nowadays He's uh, he's kind of just giving up that side in terms of economy He's moving a lot of his army forward velez is adding his first talent center since his actually original one went down I just feel like yo is making it way too open of a game like he's attacking from multiple angles now which I think yeah, like the the Multiple angle thing has obviously led to some success, but it also is Has made it more difficult for him to defend Um, that's true No, I think like something you would have done hara Is maybe just outpost in the south and you would have focused on like 20 more farms at home And then like prep the stables, you know Yeah, yeah, and whereas yo is a big push. Yeah, it was like let's drop castles all over the map Which is gonna leave to more success in the long term But obviously could lead to some uh, some problems at this stage Yeah, and it really just depends on how how well he's multitasking now because all the kesheks know hara the kesheks are stepping ballboard cannons Yeah, there's no arbels back home and it's just three four cashews But look at that one cannon goes down the second one's about to go down other than once it runs to the tc though Wow. Yeah, that's a really smart play there Yeah, that's that with two maybe three cannons plus the treb still firing and I guess you could make arguments that velez's velez's push is more awkward for him because he can't have all of his cannons there now And his micro is going to be more awkward for him. But man, he's killed a lot of villagers here. Yep A lot of those going down that castle will go up guys, but I don't know if it's worth it. There's like 20 of us went down there for yo He's still up 30 odd bills here, but he is still under pressure from the bomber cannons Yeah, and the kesheks are there. There's like random skirmishers The only tc velez has could go down to the treb which is now being attacked by villagers And I guess the treb will go down. This is crazy This is madness. Like if you're just tuning in your part, like what the hell is going on? What even happened? Where did the players even spawn on this map? But it turns out mr Yo made it crazy enough to secure game one Really well played there with the all-in castle int imperial lich play. I think was uh, it was really nice Honestly the play of the game for me and it wasn't like really on paper the play of the game But to me is the most impressive was a tower from yo. Yeah, that was crazy He didn't like you said if you had a market You could check the market prices and you would see The price of selling stone had changed so you would know but he did not confirm that and yet it was just perfect and it even kind of led to him trapping an army and Mr. Yo was looking good. He did have a really weak start against accm in his semi-final He went down three games for those who missed it responded with with four victories to win four three and I think that was the Highest level reverse sweep i'd ever seen in the best of seven, but he didn't start off slow here. Eugene Yeah, takes game one there and that's just massive for the confidence guys because you know game one is a set map It's neither player's home map. So taking those games is gonna do you wonders for the series I believe there's three set maps and then three home maps for either player by the way in this best of nine series So yeah taking game one putting uh putting yo in a good spot, but there's plenty of time for a comeback It's not over not even close to being over just a nice little uh step in the door I guess you can say yeah, I mean one victory feels like nothing in the best of nine when you've got to get five so uh Oh gg. I think that Is how we're going to see a lot of these games play out though. I think feliz is going to have potentially more success With the faster archer sieves. He's still got britain's out there vietnamese Saracens, these are all sieves that might play similarly on upcoming maps Yeah, just speeding up here, but this is yeah, this is big nomad. Now the way it was structured was yo gets to uh Yo gets to pick his map the game number two. It's not loser gets to pick. Oh velez will get to pick next regardless of what happens here And so yo goes directly to nomad. We have two nomad powerhouses. We got the spanish for yo Who build faster? That's one of the big reasons they're strong. Yo, we'll have his tcl quickly and then we have the koreans for velez Yeah, and the thing is like guys Spanish for yo, that is his pick on nomad Like yeah, I have to talk about this It's literally his favorite pick on nomad in a tournament where he gets to pick his sieve So the fact that he has it now velez picked it for him I can imagine him very comfortable in this game too here, but koreans I don't know. What do you think? Is this a is this a war wagon angle skurms to defend the kong? I'm, not really sure how you play this one out with koreans Well, obviously had a lot of experience covering nomad and wonder warriors cup a few months back And we saw this this if matchup at times I think the big deal is is the spanish player going to have safe fish? And so when I look at the dock positions Obviously, it depends on how players play the game But I think that that could actually be really good for velez because when we think spanish we think faster start Into a fast castle into conquistadors, but if you lose all your fish early, you're not going to have the food to either a go fast castle Or be making quesadors. So I think the dock position is huge here for the finish Yeah and and a big thing so a big thing right now is that yo doesn't know where velez's dock is And he doesn't really have a good way to scout where it is except if he uses a fishing ship So I would say if yo at some point wants to get ahead of the game in terms of knowledge He needs to scout with a fishing ship. Yeah, it's just not the most natural thing to do And i'd be curious if he is going to go for that one. Okay, so along those lines This is actually insane. So you have look at yo's point of view real quick and he's scouting with sheep. This is standard stuff Velez is going to try and scout the shoreline to find the dock for yo. Look at his sheep scouting And tell me if he if he missed the dock for yo Oh my i've never seen anything like this dude because because clearly he scouted that shoreline before the house was there Which means I guess the dock was being built or maybe the villager was like somewhere else We'll have to rewind later. But velez is scouting the entire shoreline and he might never see a dock and and the thing is like He has to know that there is a dock, right? So he knows there's a dock but he's gonna second guess himself Like he might think he missed it at any point of of of his scouting He's not gonna really realize it's right at the start, right? So it's gonna be interesting. He is gonna make that loop around so he might eventually get there But I would I would just say like this is super annoying for velez to do like while trying to micro boars trying to micro his His fish to also scout with a sheep Respect like that's really good. Honestly. Yeah, this is this is uh, I think dark age on numad is one of the hardest dark ages in the game Because there's so many I mean you don't even know where your boars are at times, right? So you got to find that stuff and then you have to prioritize thinking about your strat If there is a positive here for velez, I think When in doubt you always go water against banish. Anyways so he'll most likely be going faster if you'd like to go for water and Worst case send a fire galley one direction and another fire galley the other way And so with that he should probably find that dock Yeah, and there is an incentive to dock in the same spot for velez because he's on like the big lake He's not going to randomly switch his dock to another point of the map. So he's gonna be close to yos fish Regardless whether he scouts it or not. That's a really good point actually um And uh, it's gonna come down to whether yo Actually decides to fight water or chooses to completely give it up and then continue with this plan Which is what most spanish players would like to do on this map and go conquistadors in the castle age conquistador Manganell is just so deadly and they are quite close to each other actually on this on the situation I think yo knows where the tc is for velez if you look back at his scouting He definitely lost a sheep next to velez's town center So velez has had he's got a few more now But he's been scouting mainly the shoreline and that's still so funny to me that he's scouted what 80 of the shoreline doesn't see the dock so Um, but yeah, he might actually end up finding the tc and I think that's really important for velez here because again, he's gonna go water But he might have to prioritize land a bit more if he knows yo is this close Yeah, I think the good part is he has that stone so close to the town center And so he literally has the choice to go wagons or not But I can't sit here and tell you if it's a good choice or not. I'm actually not sure myself So it's going to be up to velez whether he thinks that he you know, this is necessary He also has the option of guard tower defense But I think that's kind of fallen out of favor recently in the meta guard towers Yeah, um, I mean it does come in the guard tower defense has come in for free So I think with koreans, it's definitely uh something that comes to mind But you haven't seen tato go in guard tower defense with other civs as much these days You know the pressure is coming in a lot faster for sure And I think like the whole like stationary defense like people just got so good I always talk about this man the level it's just been raised so high that these things just don't work as they used to you know people People really punish the smallest mistakes if you're sitting back with towers, you're gonna get punished on like, you know You know any opening you give so it just feels like something that players are just so good Against at this point. I think that's the third board that comes in for velez is completely chilling here But yo fast at a feudal Yeah, it's always interesting when someone brings in a boar right before they had to click feudal and they want to go water because Normally you want as much on wood and you want as much on gold as possible here And then you can make more on the water. So for yo, uh, he's got six fishing ships Looks like he will go water. So this is really good for you He'll be faster and yo doesn't have as much on food because at least underneath the tc and he's going to prioritize the wooden gold Just a little bit a little bit more And i'm almost sure yo is doing this kind of grush because he sees velez's dock so close Like this is almost 100 because of that because i've seen yo just go straight for the kungi sitters and it's not plenty of time So he's adapting really nicely. It's just beautiful to see there velez is looking for a second dock as well I believe that villager wants to do it the sheet finally, man Well, hold on. It might be the path. Did he notice it? Yeah, he noticed it. Okay, so that that's the first time He's found where yo is docked And so that is that is a dock that he did not want to place. I guarantee you that is kind of in the bay Uh, and this is this is good for yo I mean even if it's 50 50 when it comes to the fish for a couple minutes That's so much more food income that he could in theory bring in Yeah, definitely. I I think that this is a situation that Luck played a big factor and luck actually favored yo quite heavily here And it is also naturally up to feudal age faster interesting team get town watch would not have expected that but I think he just wants to get ahead of the game in terms of You know the outpost on the map and the vision which is not a bad choice and it's gonna be a grudge war for both players Yeah, you got a villager for velez their korean villagers are kind of like walking outposts because they have so much vision So he's walking around here and he has confirmed as well that yo is there. So you might see some land shenanigans Uh both players going fires But honestly they both might struggle for fish if they continue on water because they're kind of sharing their positions right now Yeah, it's so funny because like yo is kind of like stealing the fish from velez because he's got nowhere to go really Fish so he's he's taking the the fish that's close to velez first and then he's going to go take the one that's further away But it's going to be a pretty even fight here It's going to come down to repairs and kind of backing up the low hps here Oh yo using the fishing ship to block there Look at that. That's smart thinking but the villagers there for velez. I think this will be better for velez He's got three dogs But intelligent stuff there from yo He repaired the wrong one and lost a free fire gallery there rip Wow, I mean he did trade for a fishing boat, but it's that's a big mistake, man That's something like when you're so close you can't make those mistakes, man. Yeah, and and for yo He just didn't want to instantly lose his fish Right so he can he could be happy with this. He's not investing as much into water It does feel like in theory yo should eventually lose water because of less investment, but That's a that's off to a good start there for him And he could maybe get another one velez will get the repair in just in time though. It's super close And I believe i'm not sure what the math is, but I believe one villager is just enough to keep it afloat Um when it's dying to one gallery, so definitely interesting there And velez should stabilize his own three dogs three dogs guys You should be winning the water eventually here and like t90 was saying it's just a matter of buying time for yo until he can Get the castle edge here Also, you've got villager on the most northern dock for for velez so he can repair there And he also has a villager on the shore fish on the the southernmost dock So he seems to have more repair villagers in the mix but The micro from both players have been pretty good, but I think this is where velez starts to snowball it I don't see a demo on the way for yo and he's he's actually housed. So yeah, this is really hurting him at the moment Rough. Yeah, really really strong comeback there from velez on the water It's a little early but picked it up and is now taking much better trades and it's It's just a situation where yo is probably going to give it up. He's making one more round of units I almost think that's probably a mistake. Just give it up. I think it's probably the the right call here, but i'm not sure Yeah, it's it's tricky. Um, I think like There's a potential maybe for one big demo. He's got it on the way He could potentially kill two ships because of this demo so it gets the shot kills one But at the very least Velez is fishing, you know velez is actually fishing. He's got the better spot there Wouldn't surprise me at all. The ceo consider maybe even buying some food here because i'm concerned for him He only has seven on food. He's now getting his wood in his farm upgrade. So he he's committed to fuelage for a long time here That's really rough. The farm upgrade just feels like it's gonna kick in way too slow. Yep And uh, I see a barracks coming down from velez. So he's looking um He's looking to put some pressure probably with a range now The problem is you know, yo has such good vision that I don't think archers are going to be the most impactful But it's definitely something to get some pressure on the land for sure I I really like the idea of forcing someone who's going to go fast castle unique unit into towers Because the more towers they build The further away they are from being able to build their castle. I mean, we're assuming that yo is going to do that It doesn't even look like that's possible Yeah, I don't know yo just queued up a galley by the way With the demo. So yo is struggling here, man This is I think being this close to velez on water has really hurt him I actually think like he doesn't really know what to do and the problem is we haven't really talked about it much But koreans for those who don't know get a discount on their ships in terms of the wood costs. So You know velez just likes to just play here He just likes to play into yo on water as much as possible And this is totally fine and yo is kind of playing into it Which I don't really understand why he's still committing there I think the problem is it's like sometimes you're too far gone, right? Like we talked about in the previous game with the You go all in castle age or do you build a castle and go in it's like you got to commit hard, right? Can you try and do 50 50? You're in trouble and I think yo committed hard and he's getting out classed here and this could be a fast one velez Should click up shortly And he also has the range to make archers And I mean yo is never getting castle age unless he uses the market and even then how does he stop the archers? I'm just shocked. He went for like horse collar I almost never see that on nomad to just randomly go horse collar and then set up the farms This is something that it's such a slow like food income Yeah, those farms are useless when castle age comes in if there's any kind of pressure because he's gonna have to abandon those farms So it's a slow food income that's gonna be in a risky position varies through and velez up to castle age here with gold mining upgrade Great position for him, man. Yep, seven to one eco kd I know that number uh brings back some painful memories for some people listening. Um But you got uh the market there for yo and he's gonna buy Some food presumably but he's not even on stone para. So you'd be talking about maybe nights And that's gonna take a bit of time here I think it's important for velez to use his advantages on land if he does that in early castle age He's gonna be in a really good spot Yeah, and he's actually going to stone now. Um I mean, I think stone for a forecast that just sounds like pretty oppressive. Uh, market did come down for mr Yo, and he's gonna go to stone as well So it's like his plan was conks the whole time, but it's just so delayed now, basically. Yep. That's all we're seeing Yeah, that's uh We've seen conks dominate with spanish so many times and then it's almost like there's no one between Yeah, you know, it's like you never see a game where it's like, oh, okay. They didn't get to conks. They're fine It's like no not really Yeah, this takes me back like the vivi to the vivi days, bro When he'd be like picking spanish all the time you're like, oh god, not another one of these games It's crazy. Yeah, and he used to like set he used to like his whole game plan is to set up conks Like he'll tower rush men arms anything it takes just to set up those conks behind it And it's just that powerful of a unit here. Uh, we are seeing yo wall up the map. So he's still trying this one He still wants to give it his best. It is a tournament game grand finals at that Yeah, I mean some time but yeah, what do you think about well, I guess velez is pretty close to getting a castle I was just going to say what do you think about a guard tower? Uh siege push right in front of that town center that would look really strong I think guard tower is a little late for that. I think to go guard tower you probably have to tower and feudal age and then it Then it becomes guard tower. So it would have been an interesting choice Especially when we saw the farms come down. I wouldn't have minded it but At this point probably just siege castle and velez is completely chilling up 11 workers now because he has that water completely one at this point Yeah, there's no Like variation there's not a ton of variation to this version of nomad. There's no like middle pond. There's no little inlets It's you know, it's pretty safe. You know spanish are going to be going water. You got to beat him on water Velez was right next door to him both on land and on water and Feels like even if yo gets a castle up Velez is going to have one too and I hope he just places it forward here. I would not suggest Placing it defensive you have the position take it velez Yeah, you definitely just go forward. Um, especially when you see your opponent still feudal age I would have even suggested that he he sends the villagers before he gets the stone to be ready to just drop it forward Yeah, now it's a little late. He's still gonna commit to go forward though He's sending six villagers there now does have the magma on the way. So siege workshop was forward for yo, though That's interesting I can test the position a little bit. I mean, I guess with good micro There's potential for you to deny this And then drop his own god, there is potential Ah But it's gonna be tough chance. Yeah now now I think it's probably done. I think you have to oh, oh no Oh my god Oh, it's spanish builders, man There goes the shot for yo, obviously velez is gonna see what's going on here This is yo dodges, this is no joke, man Yo could complete his castle and then deny velez's castle velez with the misfire Twice he misfired here. So he hasn't hit the villagers One shot connect there. Mr. Yo dodges out on that one shoot the maggot. Oh, no way No way dude. No way. Can he repair his no way? Okay, one for two and he wins the castle war What? And now velez doesn't have the stone for a castle now You should buy one or just wait a little bit in place of defensive But yo has just been given a slight opportunity back into this game Dude and even and he's still on stone. So it does feel like okay. He's adding a town sign at home He wants to kind of play the long game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah He's taking this as a win to kind of get into velez's head play the long game with eco and try to Find a way back into the mid game here Definitely do not mind that situation not making a single conch though. Very interesting Yeah, and what what about velez in the north there hara? He's about to transport three crossbows over Oh my god, I think you're spot on I think yo's just trying to fake him out Yo doesn't actually have the food economy to make conchs anyway So he's just trying to catch up on land and these three crossbows are going to be devastating to yo Yeah, I think by the way, it's a small thing man But like if you're doing this it has to be four crossbows so you can two-shot villagers like it just has to be Come I mean, it's it's three is still fine Yeah, I know but like it it is the difference between like getting one or two more kills Yeah, we'll see if it ends up mattering. But you know, it does get one He's forcing a lot of uh, a lot of idle time from yo at the very least here, which is not too bad Yeah, and and you can see it in the score You can see it in capture age losing your fish is just it's so bad And it's especially bad when you're trying to make a unit that calls food like the key store For velez, he's done a lot of redocking which is something that a lot of mid to lower level players can learn from He's docked in the far south there. So he's more efficient fish and he's expanding to second and third town center right now So even though yo is on two tcs It just really feels like yo is going to be behind unless velez makes a couple more mistakes Yep. Yeah, I think that yo is on the perfect composition to force those mistakes with megal's and conchs, you know Eventually he'll get to that composition and that's probably the only thing that can get him back in the game is some big shots And then you know some momentum Um, but right now he is just chasing across was in his base and he he will deal with them. Yeah, I think The risk here would be if There was Five or six conchs with a couple manganelles and then a forward castle in velez's face And then velez starts to fall behind but velez is even stonewalling here Grand final stonewalling still has a stone for castle as well So he could he could fortify his base up and he should have no problem And no shame to stonewall. It's a grand final. You just take it There's no there's no point of taking risks at this point. Yeah, like this is really smart. I love it. Yeah and Uh, are you implying that there's shame in stonewalling and ranked games here hara? I think there's a lot of shame of stonewalling Oh, yeah, of course. Mr. Mr. Hussark doesn't want to be stonewalled out. Oh, yeah guys Cheating you can't just like wall out my favorite unit Exactly, man, even halvedears is cheating, but i'm not getting there. I'm not getting there. Even halvedears It's on the it's on the fence of shame, but stonewalls. Definitely that's past it for me Well, I haven't quite gone stark level, but uh, yeah, I have been uh stonewalling a little more You know if i'm gonna get raided because I suck with archer sieves, right? So I just gotta get right just gonna get raided at both corners of my base if I ever go archers up the middle So i'm like there i'm like screw it. Let's just stonewall. And so i've done it more than I ever have But that's like two times a month. I don't know that's a lot You have like a quota you're like mark it down on the calendar when you stonewall. Yeah, it's like It's like you have the signs in the warehouse. It's like it's been this many days since there's been an incident It's like it's been this many days since I stonewalled in this town. Oh god Yeah, I mean listen, I'll give you an excuse because you have been making some progress with the with the rating I've been seeing the tweets man. Not too bad. They're good job on the on the progress there. I love it I'll take it. Oh god go into the castle Yeah, he's just kind of running around with those conks There's a couple wagons now to chase them and guys wagons die to conks on low numbers But when they get ballistics, they can be uh, they can be kind of annoying to deal with here I feel like if yo was on three town centers this whole time I would have liked his position a lot more because he does have the conk factor But I love the guard tower from velez That might be denied if yo would need another miracle Uh micro moment here, but now he's gonna lose his megadel and that's an amazing position Yeah, all of a sudden it's actually velez with the push and not yo who's like getting the momentum So yeah, you just feel like you're behind on water eco land eco and you're defending a push It almost feels impossible to come back now for yo, he's getting bloodlines trying his best, of course with the conquistadors Wagons are big though. Yeah, and wagons will benefit from ballistics And I'd love to see velez consider maybe a forward castle where that guard tower is because there's no real way Be able to stop that now that the guard tower is up He was a fighter man, he's not gonna quit for a while here But I think it's like when he starts to lose tcs and then another castle comes up. I just I don't know what his win condition is at that point Pitting in about dragon on games when it comes to like big tournament games Like do you think it's a factor of like, you know, try and tire your opponent out Is it just trying to make your opponent work for it? Um take there. I mean in my case I don't pay attention to score as much when i'm in a tournament game Okay, I am. I just don't look at that as much because I am so much more focused like And that can lead to some Some not focusing on other things too. Like do I have 175 villagers which happened in wondering warrior's cup? I just didn't realize so I think You guys are somewhat human at least and I imagine that's part of it too. Um, and also maybe yo realizes that Water influences score a lot and there's a lot of leftover navy for velez So a lot of that score could be seen as kind of inflated in his mind Yeah Yeah, and I think the the problem the problem with it is the worst feeling I think is like tapping out of a game And then you you realize man, I could have actually won that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah That's for me the big feeling that i'm trying to avoid I don't want to ever tap out and then you know feel like man What would have happened if this this or that so just staying in it until the last minute feels like a reasonable thing for me Guard tower rush continues to creep forward here trying to take that hill Um good magnet micro there. Oh, that'll be a decent shot. But yeah, I mean there's still towers. There's still wagons And there could be a castle right beneath this Yeah, and it's not like this is the best of nine grand final It's not like these guys are like hey, we got to hurry up in two hours. I gotta be somewhere like This is the only thing on their agenda for the day So they should play it out if they think they've got even a small chance here. Yeah, i'm a hundred percent gamers, bro They got no no real life. You heard it here first That's somebody said okay I'll say it about me any day man. I haven't left my basement in a few weeks. No, no worries here No worries. I I think it is pride man. It's like uh for me. It's like, you know, how dedicated I am It's good, man. It's good. Hey, you could call it dedicated. I guess Definitely. Hey, um, can you pronounce the unique tech that velez is researching right now for me? Uh, yep song Okay, we're gonna commit to that one. I think I think that's around how I would say it. Yeah, ram Fong for for yo, and he's dropping a castle here. I mean that castle will clear up the guard towers And it will push back all the wagons So he has that but then again velez is on the way to the imperial hl Yeah, and that tech for those who don't know it gives guard towers an extra two range It used to be a bonus for the koreans with the kind of shifted uh shifted it back to unique tech and castle age So, uh, those guard towers are actually eight plus four super annoying 12 range guard towers But uh, yeah I don't think it's really gonna matter whether yo can stabilize now because imperial h is the point in the game where castles stop Mattering once the siege comes out trebs are huge and we do have that at least one castle from velez going to imperial h here We're seeing the fight from yo that he had in him to Come back for three in that semi-final Like like so many players would have tapped out in this game already So many players would have just they wouldn't have been able to play their best who wouldn't force straight in that series And this is the type of player yo has always been he's always had that grit always believes in himself and uh He might think he's got a zero zero Uh, sorry a point zero zero one percent chance right now, but that's still enough for him That's still enough for him still a chance. I think in his mind. He sees that he's got like two castles He's like man if I can just stabilize, you know, I have con production Um, but the the situation is actually quite dire We'll see what happens in a minute when velez does get to imperial age What I want to see from velez now just to kind of secure the game is him to expand onto these other resources We see him we see him, you know expanding in his space But just kind of go to the top there take that golden stone that you might not be able to take later That's just one way to secure the game just in case I think it's really good to get into the habit of doing that kind of safe when you're in the lead moves Yeah, I feel like an outburster that now poster too would be helpful as well Yeah, uh there we got inquisition here. So yo is gonna try and go for monks now Oh, man. I mean, I love to see it. I love to see it But uh feels like this was needed a while ago and I think there's actually a good chance here when he sees imp that he might uh End up tapping out. Yeah. Yep If he doesn't resign just about now, I you think maybe he should have tired of these out But yeah, there it is. The g just called one one in the series There were these it takes a really nice win on nomad versus mr. Yo. Yep, which was yo's home map. Well, you know nomad has Uh rng factors has luck factor and I think velez lucked out Docking right next to yo Um, if yo would have gone for water, which I think is an approach you can justify And his fish were somewhere more secure or somewhere. He could fish more freely as they're fighting Uh, yo could maybe transition to the conquisto was a lot faster a full credit to velez though When he realized the situation he went three docks And something we didn't touch on as much but he was milling the berries milling the deer He was transitioning his economy off of just the fish as well. So he did a good job and uh series is tied up Yeah Really with the uh solid play overall I feel like he didn't miss a beat on the strategy aspect of things and uh, it's going to be going into game three now It's going to be velez's home map and we're right back to basically even game and it's just the best of seven from here Basically, but both players kind of went through a couple games. That's how I thought you probably should think of it as a player That is right back to to tie it up Game three is around the corner now Yeah, and what you're able to do now if you're velez you actually pick the next map the way this is structured. So I think You all got to pick that map even though we won game one velez gets to pick the next map and then I think game four and five are set and then the rest of the Maps on your screen or home maps and that's going to be based on the scores and whatnot. So Just a little different. It's not loser picking home map Uh for these games anyways Let's hop into the game and take a look at it. Uh, for the record though bay and cup are actually my favorite maps Just that now that we're on the topic when it comes to hybrid maps, you you didn't have to say that you I didn't feel bad It's cool Well, it's not even just because you felt bad just because I always win on those maps So it's like I feel good about it now. You do you're not wrong there and also some like electric wins as well. So um, well We're talking water And velez has italians which I think is one of if not the best civilizations for water maps like straight up water maps And then also you could consider them one of the best for hybrid if you can consider that to be hybrid um Cylians for yo, I think they do have a decent tech tree when it comes to water and then They've got some weird transport bonus, which we probably won't see but yeah long story short Velez I think has this advantage going into this one Do the sims like that? Like a free transport when they make a dock or something. They did they did and now it's now I think it's their transport is Wait here or something it used to be a transport appears from their dock And they change it so many times. I don't know if it's a free transport, but you have to create it or if it's like A discount on transports. I would have to check I'm not even sure what's going on with the cecilian transport these days Maybe some of the check and let us know here guys, but um Yeah, anyways bottom line is cecilians will be weaker on the water as tonight was saying yeah compared to the italians But on this map as you can see from the side It's really hard to wall like the entire side you could wall one side pretty comfortably But oftentimes it's gonna be hard to wall both sides. So land pressure is definitely on the cards here For mr Yo, he feels like he doesn't want to straight up crush versus Velez Yo, uh came forward really early and he was able to get away with two goats So I would do the same if you feel like you're at a simp disadvantage You most definitely want to try and get an advantage early and so stealing that food can be helpful Would you prefer to see a galley opening or a fire opening on the water here? Oh, I think it has to be galley because whenever you have water that's like pretty big like this one This one's like pretty big. I think Galleys are almost always better because as soon as you get four you're just kiting and you can just run around forever So definitely galley is if you're going water However, I will say if there's a landing situation you want fires if that makes sense. Gotcha. Well, I um This is the first time I think in our cast that I I slightly disagree. I think uh When I have seen galleys anyways It's really tough to get that transition into the barracks and the range and whatnot, which we tend to see Um, it can dominate water But I I really like the idea of going to dock fires and no more just continuing to produce Then switching immediately to land as yo is walking across the map right now Yeah with a villager and that's actually before he docks by the way So is this like a sneaky dock or is he just gonna completely ignore water? I think he might try and deny the dock but it feels really weird. Oh to try this When you have to walk the whole way it's like even if you kill the ville that your ville hasn't been working Oh, and he missed it He's going back Actually, velez has to go back with that village of what velas should do is sneak another bill right now and just dock You know what I mean? Well, velez is not expecting the ville but he's gonna see the ville and be like wait He's got a loomed ville and then yo is docking at home. This is actually oh my this is actually really sick from yo He's delaying the dock and his dock will be faster, but he didn't get a ville kill obviously Falling the shorefish. That's so smart, dude He's gonna he's just pissing off velez but let's gonna go up to the right side. He wants that shorefish. He's gonna find one there Still delay the dock quite a bit though. That's gonna be like a whole fishing ship's worth of delayed Yeah, potentially obviously that the villager was walking around but now you've had what two idols for velez Plus velez is down two goats. I mean, these are the little things that can make a difference Yo's Villager will be happy to run around as long as there's at least one villager from velez chasing all the time, too Actually, like and I think the thing about the situation is that Without the scout like if both guys have a scout no one can really kill the villagers So this is just a trade-off of idle time and velez did commit to loom by the way So it's completely even on the land in terms of idle time and loom Well, it is cheaper to go up to the next stage with italian still I like how yo is happy to run away with a full hp scout or not full hp. Sorry, but higher hp scout And doesn't really want to take engagements And now i've been losing every scout fight lately i'm pissed you you have been Yeah, i've been losing every scout fight lately It's going out with a little bit of extra hp such a good feeling like yeah haven't had in a while Well, I would just hate to be in velez's shoes Yo is notorious for things like sneak villagers and like forwards and Stuff like that and now there's a villager here And you want to stop it But the only way to stop it is to chase it and you don't want to chase it So you just decided not to do that. So it's uh, it's got to be awkward here for sure There's actually I I think we're moving towards the meta where especially when there's weird maps in tournaments forward villagers And as he's still doing it a lot forward villagers give a ton of value in terms of messing up your opponent's plan Yeah, and that's something we're seeing Quite successfully here in this game and just that forward villager Veles has to always think about that. Yep, and he doesn't know what yo is gonna go for I I think it'd be funny if yo docks right next to his dock like if he were to build his second dock right here on the front and then again, I guess he couldn't defend his own fish as much but As veles is still going to be up and now his house is even being attacked So now he's got to make more houses like oh god, this must be so annoying. It's so annoying Yeah, like now he's dropping that two houses I think the forward dock is a little bit risky though Because then you're disconnected where where your fires come out and that's actually a pretty big deal So probably dock at home for you. It makes more sense if he wants to go to the water, but Hold on. He's looking like a t90. You got it, bro I mean it probably probably won't work, but it made sense to me in my brain. So Yeah, yo agrees and that that rock is a wall. So I think yeah, this is totally fine Yo, we'll get this dock up and just have that short person nearby as well And this will make it near impossible Well, actually I say this but even vales' docks are kind of disconnected here pretty interesting. Yeah a little bit Like what's annoying is wherever you're going to fish there's going to be that dock there that you have to do something about so As good job for vales with a faster feudal to kill the scout for yo, or at least he's working on it Oh, oh, he's gonna get it for no way. He's gonna get it It's I mean he's got a long way to run surely There's gonna be a kill here. Yeah, there it is Okay, and yo just household in a villager for vales. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Yeah, yo's like this isn't your house, but you live here now You live on the outside of this house in between two two trees oh god Oh And you can in theory make a galley and kill that bill later if you even want to he's gonna go for another wall And I think yo was looking for it I have no clue what's happening, but harry what you said to your point about being disconnected This is a concern for you. Oh wait yo could kill the villa actually Yo is also taking some hits back home and there's so much to focus on Yeah, only imagine how the players are feeling right now Yeah, and this just isn't the type of game that vales ever wanted with italians He wanted to go to docs go fires or galleys whatever and now yo has turned it into a different game But still vales he has the edge when it comes to the fire ship engagements And so that's at least good for him as yo is making a forward archer range But hold on vales did get town watch actually vales sees it. Wow town watch is a huge one to the board villager Sick man sick. Yeah, so now he can wall it out And in theory continue to win focus on water yo, though is not finished on water He's been repairing a little bit but lose a fishing ship But I think he'd take losing a fishing ship if it would mean winning the water in the future fights A good micro for vales as well and vales backs away. This is a sick game here hara Sick and and fishing ships are like villagers guys Like if you have a fishing ship on one hp you almost don't care as long as it's working safely after that So using that hp is just so smart to get that lead on the fire galley Front of it here. So what's more difficult to to control water from yo's point of view or vales's point of view right now? Dude I don't I don't I think it's I think it's probably equally It's hard, but I would say maybe slightly for vales It's harder because you don't know what yo's aggression is looking like yo kind of sets the tempo for the game Yeah, and he's also been able to snipe some fish the villager that next to the house is going to get shot down by that Archer now so she'll die But as a positive for vales, he does he did know this was coming, but he doesn't have a range yet But he doesn't have any arranged defense And yo could maybe still find his way through as yo is taking another good engagement on water the chaos is paying off Wow, this is huge and actually so what's happening right now is vales has taken the wall approach So he's going to be walling off this archers But yo can still make archers and then win the water and transport over that is an angle to take here Because there's not a lot of space The the transfer has to travel here and looks like yo is actually winning the water Vales isn't committing as hard as I'd want him to at this point I think Vales he just he didn't know what to do Like walling could have worked without the barracks, right? I think when he was adding the barracks He maybe didn't have the wood maybe didn't have the gold or whatever to make ships or couldn't micro And yo setting the pace of the game He's been untouched at home with the exception of a scout which I think died next to a wood line or something And this is These are the types of games I love right like I love the meta breakers. I love the messiness Vales has a villager on the left. That's now going to go down to two archers This is all mr Yo right now. Yeah, like going forward what every water map or hybrid map should be in tournaments where there's things that could happen Every game is different and it feels like there's no set kind of meta and this just leads to games like this I think where uh This is what it's just a high level atrium part is all about being able to adapt on the fly Having a prepared strategy and being able to kind of mix it up based on the situation based on what your opponent throws That you hear looks like yo is trying to go cast a by the way. He's got five farms No horse collar. Oh with horse collar. Actually, it's pretty huge Isn't it? Isn't it funny though? Because like I guarantee you like your mindset right now is like oh, I appreciate this This is so cool variety variety If you're in vales's shoes, that is the furthest thing from your mind You're like true my god, like what what do I do like? Ah, my whole strategy's ruined like ah, play the game normal You know like yeah, that's a caster though. We're just like oh, yeah, this is cool man. This is fun Yeah, that's the thing man Like these these games are the hardest to play for the players But also the most frustrating like if you're losing these games, yeah, you're all over the place. You're flustered It's not like you lost because of some micro you lost because there's just so many things going on and you just got beat to them basically Good demo there, but let's do small wins. Yeah. Yeah small win also But end up being massive if you could keep both of these ships alive, but it doesn't seem like they're cooperating. Oh, he's blocking himself. Yeah Yeah, now yo, he gets away with that one. Yo any transfer ship going going through not really yo, you're kind of kind Yeah, you're kind of abandoned that that archer play. He made two forced them off the wood line and Well, to be fair like vales is producing a lot of archers now as well randomly Yeah, and I think for yo The outpost on the right side of his base is so important Because if the archers were to come in he'll have vision on that now I think yo his food eco is going to be good enough where he might not even go archers in the next stage I think he might just go into a stable And personally, I like to see the stable at home because if archers do come over you want to have an answer for that Yep I definitely agree with that. Yeah, I definitely agree with that I would even maybe expect two stables from mr Yo at home as well and just like just play nights from home now and yeah, and you're kind of chilling like The good thing about nights is the mobility. So if you just do them from home, you're always safe And then you can just push out no problem Yeah, it sucks if you're from vales' shoes because you kind of want to fight back on water But now like maybe 25 of the fish are gone You're already behind on water. So he's not gonna do that. Look at yo stable. Are you sure licks isn't playing right now? He's going full licks, man. It's just like he's like this is what i'm gonna do. I want you to look at it Yeah, i'm going nights. You try to stop it. That's what he's saying to his opponent right now He's just like that's really that's probably not wise age of empires Like I feel like you should hide it but there's also the mental aspect where why not show them that and freak them out? Unless he's insane and makes one stable there and then two stables at home forces vales to wall one way and then attacks him from a completely different angle But I don't know if those mind that might be like just way too much mind games and vales. Listen, he's he's on the attack He wants to make something happen here because he feels he's behind and he's gonna find a villager I think this is maybe the first strategical flaw we could call out yo out for it's just not expecting his opponent to go range units because He's had range units for a while It would there's no water for vales. He should expect something and fortunately for yo, he can damage control He's he's not gonna lose many more villagers here. And I'm sure one night we'll deal with this But uh, just a little sloppy there for yo could have made more of his situation He didn't like all this I don't sound like he's shifting his goal like all of a sudden if yo somehow loses this game You come back to this moment and you think like man that was actually a big mistake because he Yeah He's really like taking a lot of damage to what it what shouldn't have even troubled him in the slightest besides that one build on the walls He's gonna make a knight now to clear it up. He is slowly pushing from his stable at vales's position as well now Now going to the siege workshop. So that's his main plan here. That's his main plan. Yeah, uh, and you see vales hop out There's actually small potential for vales to deny this because he's gonna run out with his archers And yo notices now the knight's gonna come out for yo as well. This is gonna be really intense for vales Oh, he's not able to get it That's just so huge because the ships they are blocking the the situation and now the villager Will definitely be able to uh get that uh, siege workshop up house behind the toe of vales. We'll stay safe here Uh, vales archers will be found now Yo is chasing them with a knight and a town center at home from yo I actually like this because he's Sicilian. So you definitely want to get town centers. Yeah Yeah, and he's such good foodie kill that doesn't rely on the water So he's bushing And vales is very much in a position where vales has to throw everything out this forward And I think it was going to have a massive lead This has been one of the more entertaining strategies that i've seen in this tournament If not the most entertaining denying the dock delaying the dock using the forward ville Transitioning to eco behind this is so well played for mr yo And I swear it's almost like that forward ville won in the game because that completely like yep Just threw the timing off from vales and italians are nothing but a sip of timing if you know If you really think about it with the cheaper age up, you know The water is just a fight of timing as well So it's just like throwing that whole thing off 30 seconds just makes such a big difference Now the siege is coming in now. The knights are pretty unstoppable. They will break in here. It seems Yeah, and if if they get any more damage in we're borderline at gg already because Oh god, I think even if there was no damage and yeah, there's the gg Literally if there's no damage the economy is still gonna be better for yo The control is still gonna be better for you less still needs to get a lot of conversions which he was going to try for Uh 25 minute game, but that was like as entertaining as some of those crazy back and forth games that go an hour. So cool 100 yo with a clean strategy and what we consider to be the weaker sieve on this map here Um, and yeah To be honest like of all the games i've seen on this map It just felt like the meta or the winning strategy was a little bit of water fights as you said fire galleys actually Tend to perform really well in messy games and Then you just try to get a forward position with some sort of land attack It's just been so successful one thing we didn't talk about as well is that yo got both? Farm and wood upgrade and castle age so he was actually prioritizing his economy while pushing on the land and I love to see that yeah, um sick stuff and and that's I have not talked a lot about saving strategies in a tournament like this I don't think yo necessarily did But I don't think anyone did that to velez before I think that was the first time velez had ever encountered something like that Um, which obviously helps if that were to become meta and by the time velez makes it to the finals He's prepped to deal with it gg for yo, but uh Definitely lining up to be a series that's going to go back and back up back and back. Well back and back back 20 seconds away from this next game by the way coast and mountains the map hunts versus poles Very interesting dude. What do you think of poles by the way? I'm tired of seeing this have been passed over. It's so good Is it not well not on hybrid maps. I don't think hybrid maps is they're very good So that is a little alarming for yo, it probably comes back to having like not having options I would maybe even prefer to see portuguese on a hybrid map um No, I think I think the polish eco Is insane. Yeah, it's absolutely insane And it is something that if they're given the time They're able to dominate virtually any civilization And it's not they're a bit goth like in some stages where it's not even down to a good kd It's just making so many units so, um, I one of my biggest regrets as a caster was um And I mean I was right at the end of the day, but you know, sometimes I like get focused on certain things I remember uh, red bull last year vinchester picked poles And I was just like so annoyed with him picking poles because you know vinchester's reputation for a while Was to pick a sieve that he shouldn't and die, right? So like I listened to that back and I was like, dude, you gotta shut up Like I just said, ah poles suck. Why do you do poles? And I feel bad about that still but but afterwards, of course like three months later Everyone's starting to figure out the poles so I can kind of see why you might have done that. So What do you think about poles in? On coast to mountain though, because when you're thinking poles you're thinking Lining stone and receiving a bit of gold as well and you're thinking about the farming eco usually And so I actually think that the biggest weakness is being forced to play water because then you don't farm it It almost seems like yo is not playing water this game actually. Oh Yeah And because of that weakness like basically there's two things that make poles not gonna stay overpowered but strong It's the farming around the full works that is really strong and then the next bonus Which is the mining stone that also gives you gold that just opens up so many doors like forward castles You know stuff that you can't do with other civilization. I think that's why I really like them And I think that their late game is definitely very solid as well But not docking on this map like that's there's a risk to that. I'm not sure what you think about that one Yeah, I just So so here's what should happen, right? If yo wants to go for no dock Then velez is scouting the shoreline with his camel right now He will see no dock and he will just add a second dock of his own and he'll spam fishing ships So as it stands velez already has one eco up over his opponent because he's open with the dock It's going to be like 5 10 and I don't know polish farms are necessarily good enough To to bring you back from that deficit. So I guess we are going to see a dock for yo Uh a little weird to see it at this point though Because usually players send one villager this direction right away And then they build the tc with the other ones dude. Is this like a 200 iq play to like Make your point. I think you're not docking and then you have a dog, dude There's no way he stopped that through though. Yeah, true. You're right. Because now if you look at the scouting for velez He assumes there's no dock Also, if he were to lose the camel there, oh that would have been sick that would have been crazy Actually, you can tell by how yo garrison there that I think he really wanted to kill the camel Like I think he knows this dock is very sneaky to be honest. Okay It's so hard not to give yo credit for those things But I feel like if we were to ask yo, he'd just be like no, I just forgot I forgot to say that vill That that's the thing like you don't want to put them on such a high pedestal like oh my god He thought of the craziest thing when you're casting but at the same time, you know This is a very odd thing to do So you wonder like it could either be something very potato or very like intelligent then he's close to losing a vill here To this elephant and he yeah house trick. There you go. He's good Do you think that should be patched out or is that something that just has to stay in the game? Yeah, I think it's good. Okay. I agree Well, take it away the magnol delete though, you know about that, right? Well Are they taking it out with hill advantage or just the normal delete because it's the dumbest thing in the world where you can delete a magnol And flat ground that do the same amount of damage. This is the stupidest thing ever. I know it Moments, but it makes zero sense. There's at least some sense to if you're firing up the hill Uh deleting which is which is a risk I suppose to do a little bit more damage So I don't know which one I don't know if it's both But I think that's a good point. I have no idea probably it's definitely good for the game These shots where people are on flat ground deleting their their manganelles to make the manganelles do more damage. It's just Yeah, I have to agree with that Yeah, I think that's the hill one makes for a little bit of uh, you know, you can at least defend a little oh my god Yo, oh my god. That's crazy. That's a free villager Yeah, it's a free villager and even if velez would have got the first hit the polish villagers heal up So that would be an easy win for yo And you could see why there's a big difference between them and now wait a second velez can't get his second dock up He's on gold He wanted to go water And he has to send a ville across the map. I don't think that village was there for an elephant I think she's going over there to end up dock. Yep And and yo is docking on velez's forehead here. He's up 30 seconds faster Wow, man, this might just be like an instant win on the water yours on gold Yeah, i'm missing a beat here and and he's balls too So like if you win on water or at least are competitive on water and you get into farming later I know huns not having to make houses and and whatnot is is actually really beneficial for them, but That's sick. We have an immediate switch of strategy for velez though. He's going barracks right there in the middle of the map So as his camel's heading to the north to scout for yo, I think he's going to go archers now I almost just want to see a tower defense from yo like you're mining stone with poles Like as soon as he as soon as yo wins the water I think you just go to stone and tower defense at least two towers on that main land I almost want to see that and then and then develop from there So by the way, I don't know if I if this is a hundred percent, but I I trust the user who said this Yeah, apparently like the leading does makes no difference whatsoever And like the upcoming changes. Oh, okay um So my take on that is huang is gonna love it He finds out like any it really buffs all in manganell pushes which I don't think is necessarily bad for the game by the way because He sees are already pretty strong, but bad for my game. Yeah bad for your game bad for your game better for others I guess. Yeah, exactly. And I think that it's something that does Shake up things ever so slightly, but does shake it up nonetheless, by the way Velez is gonna go for two galleys and snipe fish, which is 100% the correct approach like you have to do that That's so smart and he's also going for stable on the land Uh, and we are seeing the full work and the barracks from yo, so he's transitioning to land himself But i'm just not sure how the timing is gonna play out. I I personally Would prefer to have seen a range because you're already on wood and you're already on gold And yeah, if you were to start with a normal scout that could already attack I like scouts because boom you get the second scout you're killing villagers But one scout Is just gonna force a spearmen from yo And yo will just have so much time with the spearmen to get his walls down in theory I feel like with the archers if you show up yo has to go for a tower Or he is nothing, you know, a spearmen wouldn't cut it there, but he's actually gonna add a range as well here for lez Actually fully agree with everything you just said by the way. That was uh, I have nothing to add. That's perfect And now he's adding the range but like it just makes sense to have the range first and then maybe later a stable Yeah, when he adds more archers. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's like that's how And now even I think velez is realizing like I have one scout bro. This guy's not doing anything He's waiting for a second. But yeah, it feels like not the most impactful of a push And yo is completely waiting in the water, by the way And uh, yeah velez managed to have a couple fish boats nothing too crazy there with the galleys But this is this is crucial timing if you look at yo's camel He's scouting the base and he's not going to see anything and I think the positioning of the buildings for velez as well as the patience with his army because he is waiting for an archer Is so important here. I do not see yo getting all of his walls down in time That said velez is attacking the barracks, which has to be a little misclick there and that's going to give you a bit of a heads up Yeah, but yo is abandoning the full walls, which I actually think he shouldn't I think you should get the spearman there and actually Brush down the full walls even if you lose one villager You just don't want to risk playing an open battlefield now against hunts So you just risk it you send two three bills your full wall and then you're completely safe on the land After that and he's making a tower, but like it just has to be full walls here. It's so much better, no? I mean, he doesn't know exactly he sees the archer. Maybe a little concerned. You got to make the decision right away, right? Yeah, he might try and do both. Actually, I guess the tower would defend the wood line in a sense True. True. I don't even mind it. Yeah, I forget to mark it and the house. I think it should be enough stonewall Oh god hate to see it. Well with poles. I actually love it because I mean you can go to stone a little later You can't make a town center anyways with 75 stones, so Okay, so looking pretty good for yo, then he's got some fish not as many as you would normally want And he has completely protected himself so far From scouts and archers when he had just a spearmen. He's luring an elephant to the mill by the way It's not just in loyola legends It's also in the grand finals of the 10k tournament god love to see it He's got a wall too though. Like this is completely open on the other side. Yep Um, if he was maybe on stone he could think about Some towers he's got okay. He's bought the stone But I still feel like this tower has got to be well placed here for yo I think that's good enough. He's in a wall the top tower here Yeah You shouldn't really be able to do too much there from velas and velas did the right thing by the way Just not wasting time going right to the right side right side of the base and then just trying to you know get in there um But yo is probably going to be safe and I think now he's done stone I would even say go heavy on stone as poles here It's not a bad not a bad thing to get onto you. Well, I mean I also love what velez has been able to do at home He's got a total of Seven farms. We talk a lot about transitional yiko and these hybrid maps And that on top of taking the hunt and yo is buying some food at the moment Obviously though poles can be insane if they can start to get their farms down ideally with horse with horse collar around the fullwork It becomes really really good for yo as what is that like 12 villagers dropping off the food from the elephants? That's crazy, man. He's desperate. He just buys that he gets like, okay, let's just get up there, dude It's so crazy We see two different approaches from two different civilizations and they're both neck and neck castle time like what what is age of umpires bro Like this is crazy stuff. They they both played so well in the semi-finals and they're both playing really well here But finally like the previous game was kind of over on the way to castle age And I feel like this game is going to go on for a lot longer here. So i'm happy to see that I don't think that yeah yo was adding fishing ships now. I think he should have done that a little bit earlier I think maybe he was respecting the galleys a little bit too much, but He's not really making use of the water. He's got two fishers only Also, look at this tower here for velez. He just casually built the tower. I don't think yo noticed it And now yo can't comfortably take the stone. There's also archers inside the tower So you can't hop that can you? I think you probably could but um, well, actually if you could it would be worth it Yeah, yeah, I think if you could you would so I don't think you can Well, he should be if he's trying it would be ejecting at least right Velez probably has some like honor to him, you know, he's like, oh no, that's a that's a that's a glitch Uh, do you do you really would he do that? I don't know I I mean I would take full advantage of it if I could do it and i'd laugh the whole time so I'm not the right guy to ask fair enough. I'm the same vote, bro If it's in the game, it's legal. That's how I say unless it's specifically said in the rules, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, listen, it's gonna be um, it's gonna be a cab archer angle for velez second range going down bloodlines It's definitely gonna be cab archers But I almost don't like cab archers when you have forward ranges like it gets really messy really fast I think well, I do like what he's done overall to yo's economy. Uh, yo has one single farm with the poles So that fact right there is that archer is doing a weird glitch there for velez. Uh, That's good And also velez has full vision on where yo will go whether it's in the middle of the map Where he's got uh, even villagers taking stone boldly Um, he just sees everything so he knows he was going to go scorpions or meganells here He knows yo won't have a lot of space and I think space is so important for the poles if they want to get those farms down That yeah, I think especially on a map like this where you don't exactly have a lot of space if you're naturally crammed into a corner Losing more of that from your opponent. It just makes it that much harder And velez making a night by the way, that's really smart. I see a lot of players and they go cab archers They kind of just wait till they get the mass But they're just it makes the aggression so slow so getting that one night out small investment gets to the pressure and that's huge Yeah, it is a big you know belay the monastery here for a while as well I mean think of the polish bonuses we talked about if you mine stone you get some gold from it And then if you place farms around full works Their food counts spikes and I think yo is going to start to place those farms But I mean as of now he's only placed one farm and he's barely been on stone this game So yeah, we're actually this is amazing for velez. None of the bonuses being used so far or used very efficiently Um, also that one tower that velez made that's gonna get mangled down now So it just feels like yo is Yo is struggling to set up his base Not necessarily struggling but definitely is delayed in setting up his base and only now getting to the worst of farms basically Yeah, this is yo for you though. He's like, well, this is really this isn't the best His army's coming to my base. Am I going to respond to it with my army? Nope, i'm actually just gonna hope he doesn't uh, he doesn't realize i'm gone and hope he runs into my towers But I think velez could justify running past there It's just it's always awkward in this position because you don't know 100 percent how this fight's gonna go Yeah, you don't even know what's there really but velez takes a gamble goes to the back There's a magnet on the scope in a couple towers If you might go correctly velez could do some damage But it's also a pretty easy defense from yo if he just keeps that magnet alive Oh, man, look there's so much And now the fact that yo, I mean he's attacking a mill But the fact that he actually has the knights forward right now is such a big plus Yeah, how is actually velez has nothing to defend there He's gonna rush down the town center because you realize that you just got nothing in the back there to defend But of course yo is just chilling on the coast there not too much action there And those three cabbages are being forced back, dude I'm not even sure how I think about cabbages nowadays. Like I don't even know if they're good I think you need a lot of them for them to really be scary to be honest. Well You can boom really easily while making them, which I think is a plus My rule of thumb is if you're faster to castle h it's a amazing unit But you know, yeah, you're not gonna have time to really mass them if you have even castle h compared to you know someone who mixes in What is yo doing here is someone who mixes in scorpions or knights Yeah, and in low numbers you get counted by everything you're getting counted by monks you're getting kind of by scorpions This feels like there's a lot of things that you can't get done with the cabbages They also shoot pretty slow But obviously that mobility is huge three town centers from velez only two from yo But I think you only really need to if you're using the farms properly, which he is starting to do that now Yeah, those knights he they are being moved around now But they check to see if velez would have town centered Any of those golds and stones on the shoreline? That is definitely a focus in the long term on this map. So everyone should pay attention to the mini map there Yo is just full work city over here adding another full work going to buy some more farms His food count is going to spike I think whether or not he adds a third town center here in a second really tells us his plan Three tcs would probably be better if he wouldn't have had to wall so close to the corner because now It looks awkward if you place a third one in there I think I might have rewind it a little bit But I am getting right back to speed and my bad about that chat and uh, yeah nasty The wall is going down on the top side. I almost think that yo should um Should prioritize mining stone and just in case the pressure from velez builds up because I think But but that being said you don't really care for the fast impos poles. Like what do you do here? Do you go for like? As Like cast like late caselage. I don't know what units to make here. Maybe our blood straight up. Well He's going to place a town center Now the two archers for velez that hopped out of that tower that i'm sure he forgot about might see that tc In theory velez could deny that Not with just the two archers, but maybe another cab archer, but The main group of cab archers is a long way away, but I think he notices here harrah He's heading over with a knight in a cab archer right now I feel like he's he's really on He's really on the ball. There's also the hole for the night. Oh, that's big. That's big. That's big Yeah, and and this is this is going to allow velez to really snowball this he's got three town centers Remember he didn't have fish for very long in this game And if that town center would have gone up it would have been even but now that the tc is not going up This will mean velez takes the lead I I yeah, I actually think I much prefer but let's position here because keep in mind guys on this map There's a hill at the top. So if velez isn't sitting at the top of the base there Ooh, if that ground comes in clutch those scorpion hits also quite heavy If you stay at the top you have the hill bonus I just don't know if that's enough incentive to stay there He might want to just run. Yeah, I think with yo having one monk there This is actually the perfect amount one manganell three scorpions and one monk And there's nothing velez can really do but he might this is where I get stuck because if I were in velez's shoes I would do okay He's going for a siege workshop. That's what I would want to do He's going for a siege workshop, that's what I would want to do But anytime I get a considerable amount of siege my opponent's gonna have a castle with poles Because of their uh because of mining stone this whole time. So yeah I don't know. What do you think about the siege good to apply pressure anyways, I guess Like I think you probably want to go siege from velez's position because you don't really know if you're behind or not And I think you think you're behind these are some nasty shots from the manganells, by the way from yo I will say so I think siege is good Um, and I will say even if there's a castle on one side, you can still push the other so it's not yeah bad. That's true But I do agree like I I think poles are extremely tricky to play against in this situation If I was joseph to imp what these full works are insane, man I'm that's what I'm telling you you gave poles away. You know what I mean? Like poles was the second safety gave away Oh god, it's so strong people need to respect the sieve well Again in theory velez who's collecting relics in the middle of the map, which I hate I prefer he take them home But um in theory velez will be up relatively soon because he hasn't been spending a lot of food He's only making cav archers But I think early imperial age is where poles can shine if it goes late The fact they don't get the final armor upgrade on their cav really hurts But after that unique tech, which is I don't know how to say it. So I just say sriracha privileges after sriracha is completed, uh things get pretty hot and uh, There's could be 50 60 70 cavalier and I still think that's too cheap. I think like 60 off Combined with all these farms is maybe a bit much for the poles. That's how strong they are I think you definitely Slow it on the farms before touching that tag that that is like baby. Yeah, it's really expensive Dude, I think you just go we can start here. Honestly, of course you Why why yes, but no like it's actually good here Well, yeah, but so is cavalier cavalier ends the game No one doesn't So you're saying winged hussar because cavalier is not strong enough and then you save up a bunch of gold and then flood With your gold bank because if you go if you go cavalier, then you okay, he's gonna go cavalier Sriracha privilege is the only you're the only person in the top 20 who would open winged hussard and actually think it's a good idea Because you open hussar you sign your gold You spend your your food. Excuse me, and then and then you switch to arbalest and like boom I have a perfect comp if I go cavalier then what do I do after then? I have to get the hussar attack later. So, okay, we'll see if you'll lose this come back to me, bro I might talk some shit but come back to me. Yeah. Okay. Hey, I mean I have no, you know, you could you could I could pick your save every game. I'd probably still lose. So I I don't really know if it's like we should turn this into a competition because I'll lose but uh Cavalier is on the way and I think velez is gonna expect this but I haven't seen Additional barracks for him yet. Are you worried about that? uh I almost feel like against pools. You don't want barracks I think you what you should do is definitely go cow archers and if anything you want to wall the defensive castles That's better than that's better than hubs because they don't they're missing the last armor So you you actually just need to survive. Yep, and hub isn't really the way to do it. So yo had um early cavalier in an instance against accm and then also an instance against say my name so the last two players he played And what he would do is I think this is the smartest thing you can do He wouldn't address the castle in this situation. He wouldn't address the cab archers his first wave Loops around a raid and it's super tough to deal with raids Like how are you going to wall this map, right? You would have to stone wall the whole map, which is probably unrealistic And so if yo could get that in And then his follow-up army go into where that castle is. I think that would maybe be his best decision Yeah, one thing we need to talk about actually velez has four relics, um Granted they're on the front monastery, which is always a little bit scary But if you can hold that position then four relics is a really good win condition to have in a game like this where You are behind but if you just hold four relics is not bad So here you see the cavalier come out guys 140 hp, they're pretty tanky But they are missing that last armor Which uh will hurt their tankiness in the long run for shuriken's cab archers and it it actually hurts them now Like true normally you get the final that you get the imp armor. We have a lumber camp quick wall from velez a lumber camp quick wall again That's sick hunts. He can't make a house. That's insane. Actually love it. That guy's crazy But chemistry ballistics they just melted there like they just melted So you're saying that maybe the cavalier even with the unique tech could be seen as a slight waste of gold And if he would have gone winged hussar He's banking gold to make a switch later Because then yeah, because then you play like arblest because now he he bought the unique tech And if you're not making cavalier in five minutes, i'm calling that a waste right? Yeah. Yeah. He only has 15 cavaliers. So And look they're just so useless bro, like poles have to open arblest into winged hussar It's their best competition. See this is why people think pole sucks. They're not using hussar I think the the uh unique tech Whatever the other one is the one that gives them uh, like trampled damage or whatever. Yeah, I think it's pretty pricey But I could see what you mean now. I love how the cavalier getting in here though It's allowed yo to expand to the right corner. So he's able to take more of the map And he's also going to take out that monastery. That is the most triggering thing i've seen in his final so far Why collect the relics for the enemy? Just just Get your monks and make a new monastery at home. You don't have to build houses the entire game So just save the wood make another monastery and have the relics at your base Don't you feel like it's so annoying to do that though? Like I don't know. I'm not gonna say it's too hard to multicast I would say it's just too annoying to do that. That's what I think at least well I would say it is annoying but it's more annoying to lose the relics now Yeah, so it's like what's what's worse for you? I guess in the long term Yeah, and look at yo, I mean he's using this cavalier flood and he's using two trebuchets to go after the castle for velez And velez is a big mass of ca and it's probably the better army right now But yo is just spreading out with everything and continuing the flood Like whoa, that's huge I'll get a couple kills here. Now. How many ca does he send after this is my question because if he sends like 20 That's fine. He really needs to have ca on the front era down goes the castle the raids continue for yo But still no sign of a tech switch it's still just cavalier for him. Yeah, and the problem is like The longer this goes and oh co-operation from yo, normally I'd say this is a huge waste But with paul's does it even make sense to get it? Is it worth it? I think it's worth it I think what probably gonna hurt yo in a second though Is that he hasn't killed the cab archer in well, okay He just killed him as I said it but for the most part he hasn't been taking engagements against cab archers Yeah, all of him and so while vils have gone down For vales, he's still got 130 and he's now got 70 cab archers. I'm not even fully upgraded yet so you could get heavy cab archer and I don't know if yoke can engage against the death ball And he's literally turned your pop by the way Like the last is completely the worst part of a blessed position is the fact that he lost their bucks in the front and that Yo can take them. Yep That's the word and yo have five legs if he does take them, but yo coming back to the cavalier man I generally think it's not a good approach I think now he needs our bless or at least scurms but scurms will cut it because there's light cap from velez already on the field Well, I think there's concern for velez when it comes to getting light cap though because he's only got 26 on food And I think he's like sending everything with a wooden gold at the moment. He's could lose some tcs We have yo who's going to try and drop another castle This is really bold because if the ca were here it wouldn't work But all the cab archers look at all the cab archers at the main tc cavalier all chasing the cavalier It becomes so difficult when you're reacting and he's clearly realized now But the osu! castle is going to go up, which means the trebs will take out the town center Yeah here. I don't know if velez is ever going to have that eco to be able to get full upgrades on the light cap Yeah, I almost think that it might not even be worth it to switch into light cap And that you just stay you just get heavy cab archer and you just stall the game until you have Like because you can't really lose the cab archers You just stall the game until you have the hissar afterwards until you can afford it But now it feels like now he's trying to take it to light cap a little too early Oh, also, I don't think you counter attack with the with the caverns. You send them back and try to defend There's a lot of cavity on the field right now. Yeah, you could tell like this is what pressure does You could tell he thought about sending a full army forward and now he sees this And it's so tough right because you know skirmisher is probably going to be something that yo mixes in so light cap makes sense with that mindset, but The maybe heavy cav archer just boosting your best unit would be the way to do it He's certainly got the res right now, but yo He's going to take out a trebuchet Keep in mind who have all the relics And we have velez going for the final armor upgrade there for the light cap Yeah, and he's going for heavy cav archers just behind the queue on a range, but it is coming eventually here But my god, we have to give credit for just a yo, not only is he Waiting but he's also pushing and finding the right time to commit to the forward castles and take that space Because yo does not win in an all-out engagement, but he does win with the mobility and he's using that beautifully Yeah, I think the the castle that we're looking at now next to the trebs was key Because there's also a lot of golden stone there for him And the second this is what I want to see from you the second he sees the cav archers I want him to say see ya and run right to velez's base. He's like, oh, that's where your group is. That's funny I'm going to go to your base now and velez has to come back Les has to react to this. Yep, you can't move out. You have the best army in the field and you can't move out How crazy is that? Yep, it all comes back to Uh, the momentum yo was able to gain in early imp the imp timings and everything and oh jeez And I like this for velez. He's sending some of his army back because he knows he can't react fully But now there's scurms there too But this is this is yo extending his lead even further will have all five relics hasn't made a single winged hussar And uh, he's killing it Yeah, uh, dude, you gotta give him credit cavity or scurm. It's holding up for the time being however I will say velez actually has a lot of resources But I just question his ability to stabilize let's see if he can if you can just clear the cavity from his base Somehow get to his star himself, which I think the tech is on the way. I'm not sure though His composition is better, but he's down the five relics now. So we'll see how that plays out from here Yeah, it's also down to 80 villagers, which is a bit low Uh, but he does have the ca. Oh, never mind the ca aren't able to really advance back there That would have been a good spot for them where all the farms are for yo but yeah, the The ability to spam cavalier endlessly is just insane with this if yep I think if they had the final armor upgrade, it might be like the best of in the game. Honestly Thank you. I was just thinking that actually yeah, you have unmatched eco, right? Yeah, it's like we talked about camera farm slap farms. It's post farms. Like that's truly the best one. I believe Um, so if they have the last armor upgrade combined with cavalier and the trampoline i'm just crazy Stonewalls from velez. We had to see that like 10 minutes ago. I think that's yeah, it's a good move though It's a good move. Yeah. I mean, it's something that is gonna help a little bit right now But now that yo has skirmishers keep in mind poles don't get the final armor upgrade on their skirmishers either The skirmishers are actually going to help a little bit to the ca raids. Good job from velez coming in with light cap But there's just cavalier everywhere yo is trying to deny a castle for velez near the shoreline Elephants also trying to deny it Uh, man, the the problem with velez's play here is like he's trying to attack with the ca That's the wrong idea. You have to defend the ca attack with light cap. Yeah That that's what you need to do because the light cap can just run in like when we're talking about running to the Back of the farms the light cap could have done it where the ca couldn't so yep Tricky man problem here. Yeah, like and and you can't make the right decision because everywhere you go Yo is gonna see it and he's gonna switch to another area So, you know if you're it's not like you're just controlling one or two armies You're constantly making army just you probably if you had to control group the armies you're using You'd probably need to have like eight control groups because it's just patrol patrol patrol patrol all these different angles it's so random And yo, like yo is just in on the right now. Like just deny or trying to deny castle Okay, here real quick. Yeah, the camel for velez is also walled in next to the castle Is there is there a The camel's blocking the foundation imagine if he only had one villain there that's hilarious Okay, man that camel safe. We leave no man behind. It's not even a camel Gotta respect it here. And I think veliz is fully burning out here guys 160 pop for him. He's kind of at the limit of resources and mr Yo is going to see dram in his face He does have the five relics. Remember that seagull does never an issue here. See drum will break the top stone walls as well You're looking to break in the cavalier now big big moves Yeah, and sucky spot when you see your pop is 160 and then you see your ville count is 60. You're like wait what? I have a Yeah, and you always don't even feel that hundred military I would actually believe if you told me yo had a hundred military with just how the momentum has been this game Yeah, true. It's like more well positioned military for him And have the he's just throwing them man. He's just throwing them. He's got 55 cavalier And he's got 30 in q and he has 35 on gold and he has all the relics This game is well and truly over Very impressive from y'all. I want to I think the most impressive thing was actually the opening to feudal age Because velez was expecting to win water against the polls and he never had that opportunity. That was so cool Yeah, it all comes back to the little things And I think there wasn't too many mistakes in the mid game But just maybe some late game mistakes from velez cost him a little bit Maybe it's just good play from yo as I see a castle now in his farm eco Or at least close to the gold on the right hand side As you said yo loves the castle near the stone mines and the gold mines It's just his uh, that's his thing and gg three to one for mr Yo with the polls not too bad 213 cavalier were made by yo, that's crazy and he had 40 more in q uh After watching this as mr. Mistry was getting murder holes, by the way throwback there. Um Maybe cavalier is correct, man. I don't know like that. That seems pretty good. Um I would have loved to see velez play a little bit more tight on defense like just a little bit less chasey Um, but gotta give credit where credit's due and mr Yo's mr Yo's uh macro played in the late game with his military. It was fantastic really well played Well imagine a world where velez doesn't have those four relics in the middle, right? um, and then also Has his cab archer in position where the most forward castle is for yo in the north If velez like there was definitely a point where the cab archers were stronger in that mass So velez didn't chase as much right if he were maybe could appropriately assign Cab archers to the different areas, but keep that middle position as well as have the relics Maybe I know we're still talking about the polls, but maybe then Yo actually starts to struggle can't get as many cab out And if he's not hitting velez velez has his hussar, you know, like that that was the stage of the game earlier I think the opportunities were there Um, but at the end of the day Polls are polls yo, I I don't think he has a single farm placed Imperfectly here i'm looking one two three Four five six seven eight full works and I think every single farm he's made is around the full work That's just that's polls for you Yep, and I think that's something that at first I remember when the when the polls first came out people were like Completely disrespecting that bonus just making farms on the tc first and then transitioning but Nowadays people realize how strong that bonus is and it's only farmers on the full works how it should be really Um, I and I really like how unique that is for the polls as well. Yep. I like it a lot They have so many bonuses going for them Velez he is now down three to one. I'm sure that won't feel good But he even has one more game to work with if he were to lose the next game. He still has opportunities It's the best of nine but yo for me It's like if velez doesn't take full advantage in like These small moments yo is more well rounded with his decision making at least so far. That's what i'm seeing Dude, I think turks might be the most underrated civilization in the game by the way Just the amount of options they have yeah They don't they have some clear weaknesses, you know, obviously like the trash and stuff But the amount of options they have on a mix of uh compositions It's it's really good, man. Like I really like turks these days Okay, interesting. You know my according to aoe nexus My most played civilization is turks. So I don't know who's in charge of the whole random civ generator out there Uh, but uh, thanks, I guess Yeah, what's your win rate on turks? I I don't think it's that good Oh god, it's holding you back man. Yeah, I don't think it's that good. I just I don't have a lead skirmant I die these days Damn it. Yeah, no, it's hard. That's the clear weaknesses. We obviously uh, we obviously know about the turks but on this map I think the weaknesses are Covered a little bit by just how the the games tend to play guys This is yukatan you see the water in the middle of the map as well Uh, that isn't like, you know, there's obviously a lot of holes between the the ponds and stuff But that can be walled up quite easily I'm, not sure what the meta is going into like the early game, but I would probably assume it's going to be some sort of fast Cal so what do you think? Well, that was what I thought going into it, but I think I mean well It's obvious. This is a tournament version of yukatan. So it's a lot more open Uh Original yukatan would have one wood line that would wall off half your base. I mean sure yo could Wall himself in pretty easily here, but he would also wall out his stone, right? So he'd have to think about that Honestly, I think velez's base is way better because he could wall in And take back deer back berries back gold back stone It actually could take double deer. So I I guess I was thinking fast castle here But I guess we'll see what yo does because of the stone predicament, dude I have a really real strategy. I think yo should sneak a villa Full wall has basically it's so easy and just play some sort of sneak honestly Okay, go into like sneak arches or something. Yeah. Yeah, I rarely suggest this but I generally think that when you have a map that's this closed, but you have you have that stone outside your base What you probably like I would want to fc genessary if I had the stone inside But now I probably want to try a sneak to make it to take advantage of my insane map because your opponent can't scout What you have behind it Would you do that yourself? Or are you just like is that your caster brain kicking in where you're starting to think of like? More possibilities. I think I would do that if I thought of it, but I don't think I think of it in the moment I think I would think fast castle crossbow and play it like yeah more like clean and just from home But I I think that the sneak is the strongest strategy here if you if you ask me Now that i've seen the whole map, but of course Not everyone wants to do that. I want to see velez try and steal this boar right now Come on. Go for it It's it's so bad to do it It's so bad. I know he should never do that, but yeah There's one player out there mbl would maybe consider it true Yo runs into velez's tc by the way slightly so that hurts And velez could actually consider stealing this boar if he were to see it, but he's gonna loop to the left So unfortunate for him that could have been a like an easy steal actually I think Maybe not easy like it'd be blocked once again. You probably just don't want to take the boar There's so much food like in my opinion stealing a boar only matters when the opponent has less food Yep, you're having a ton of food doesn't actually help that much it feels Yeah, i'm trying to look at the turkey situation There's a lot underneath the tc for velez yo has scouted the barracks so good scouting And yo is doing the same thing. Is this gonna be 2015 drush fc from both? It's like 2015 Dude every game in 2015 and I remember the viper versus jordan invested 21 or viper is someone the best one I want It's literally fc crossbow every game and they're just micron crossbows for 30 minutes Well three tc booming no one thought they get fast ballistics. No one felt the pressure That's how it was man. Yeah that where it was that or it was scouts, but then make like three scouts And and full wall and go up So that's definitely how they play it's super super passive. The game has gotten a lot more aggressive obviously granted to balance changes but also player development and metaships definitely Is not favoring a lot more crazy approaches and cancellations. So now we're seeing it was a few more drush from yo He's getting his meal down. It's the same situation for velez and velez is not drushing Nope, he's getting the personal shout now. Oh, we cancelled it. Oh my god Wait, wait, wait, he cancelled his militia He made it then he cancelled it. Yeah, he queued it and then saw that yo was doing it And decided not to engage but now he's making it again weird uh I guess you want to see if yo's committing to three before doing three himself actually maybe maybe yeah I know i've heard you say that the two militia drush is like the worst strat in the game So yeah, he's heard your tidbits of advice on that I'm not sure if I believe that anymore though. I I kind of see some logic behind it. I don't know What do you think about it? I'm trying to get some opinions, but i'm running a survey Well, I it was on my list to bring up today while casting with you Okay You said that that strategy is like really bad and I recall you losing in king of the desert to the guy that kind of started it vinchester So I was like that was going to be my question. But um, I think it highly it really depends right? And uh, I I think that there's arguments to what either side of that conversation, right? There's plenty instances where two militia This looks really dumb But if you're able to take control if you ever to force reactions if you're lucky kill a ville, I think it can be okay What I have to do is just like whenever there's a strategy like that I think i'm gonna spam it myself do like 10 games about it and really just get my own opinion through there big engagement That's definitely a better one for yo. Yep. Yep Yeah, I actually felt like yo Is gonna lose this hard because there's one militia in their hair. I just didn't fight the whole time Oh, really? Yeah, if you like do a quick rewind if you want it just like completely got stuck in the middle I'm actually going to take a look myself here. Um And you were absolutely correct. Belize did win the fight actually I thought it looked better for yo, but it just froze It's like in the middle and he was fully surrounded got fully claustrophobic and just couldn't handle it Couldn't fight bro Yeah, and that that's a toter there because I think that fight should have gone better for yo if that unit engaged Because like Belize is running into him, right? But um, but you know, it's not gonna make that much of a difference It's going to be fc on both sides. Uh, I like how mr Yo, I don't know if we've caught up now He's actually walled ahead of his stone, which is just good good foresight because you never know when you'll need it although it is not in his um You know stone isn't in his immediate strategy right now. He just wants to fast castle I'm not sure what velez is doing but velez wants to go for Oh, he's is he adding militia? He wants to go men of arms I like this actually What I don't like is that there's a jaguar attacking is one militia. So that kind of sucks, but that's so you shouldn't use it and I think Like the way I try and look at situations most times is try and take advantage of your bonuses as fast as possible And so if you were to go fast castle with bermes You're delaying feudal which delays your free wood upgrade you're delaying feudal which delays the extra attack you get on your infantry now If the follow-up is going to be strong enough i'm not sure but look at yo yo is not expecting this Yo doesn't have a scout and if man-at-arms scout is there yo could lose Not as many as he would normally because one militia is weak in the scouts week, but he could definitely take losses Dude, how greedy is it to just go out and take a deer though? Like that's so greedy, man Oh, but he noticed make it back The bumping all villages are so stupid, man Hey, and now man-at-arms in he's got plus one attack Yo could quick wall this Everything out Oh god, that lady's not a fan. Um, oh my god. It's a disaster, bro I think it's still fine though. Yeah That looks so messy though Well the thing is though I think some of the man-at-arms could take the hill in that house And then there's going to be an archer soon So this isn't going to be that easy for yo, I think he's going to have the tower And looking at his food count, he won't be able to fc that easily because he doesn't have much on food Yeah, I think so. So the big thing here is like They've they've obviously nerfed for those who aren't keeping up. They've nerfed the houses. They have now negative one melee armor So you break through these houses quite fast with the man-at-arms and especially if you have just one or two archers to force the repairs away It's quite strong these days. So I think what I want to see from yo is Continue repairing until he's used archers and then back up and then re-defend with archers. He's committed to fuelways, by the way He got both eco grids. He's completely abandoned the fast castle approach. I love that. It's a really good move Fletching in already for velez and also if you take a quick look back at home, he's placed two mills on the separate areas of hunt so Love it. I think that's exactly what you would want on yukatan and Yo, maybe got a little baited by how close off the map was and just assumed that velez would let him go fast castle And this is some high level pressure here I mean with the blacks that just now casually being built lez could break through here or kill villagers in a second Yep, and keep in mind that one range is massive The skirmishers while it does counter the archers not in this situation where the archers can attack really? Yep Um, it does feel like velez kind of backed up a little early there I think he could have potentially forced a bit more just turning his attention towards the wood. That's fair play It's almost like he's he's expecting he won't do much damage and maybe back the way a little early Because at the end of the day, I think his eco is going to be looking a little better at home 500 food already here. He could click up at like 1630 if you really wanted to I think but he'd have no farms, which is awkward. Yeah No, but you don't even care if you're not if you can all in like you we should see a market here No, like market cells don't up with this kind of baby. Maybe Yeah that I mean he's got he's got double berries double hunt So he he doesn't even need to market if he just drops off some res here And also If he goes if he opens crossbow against yo, I think he was dead as turks turks can never go elite skirm And if there's a big difference in the castle each time It ripped for the turks It's so weird though because I actually was gonna say I preferred yo's position But i'm genuinely shocked by how fast well these food counters rising. It's amazing. It's really rising. That's crazy I feel like my instincts would be around like the middle of feudal age here to like get horse collar mixing some farms But he just dropped four mils on all the food and he's up. That is insane And yo can't do that. Yo can take double berries, but yo can't take any of his hunts Yep, and the berries while it's nice because it's free food. It's not as fast as the hunt and it You're not making use of uh of the map how you'd want to and now now we're seeing horse collar from velas He's just so good He's he's going to be in the same spot as yo But he's just going to be faster castage because he made use of the uh of the hunt first Yeah, and honestly all in it though, or do you want to see a boom? Maybe a boom is better. I I think as long as he doesn't lose his archers I I think you could do so much damage with crossbow Where you could just go three tcs, but I guess like He's bringing the villager forward. Maybe he's concerned about the lack of flexibility in the long term for bermiz I think us are and uh Hussar and cab archer is Devastating for the bermis. I don't know if they have a lot to deal with that You kind of have like because bermis have to play like cab scurm probably versus that and that's just not very good because of the Lack of armor, so that's the big issue with bermis. They have a really smooth early game He obviously got the wood up here for free. We'll get the second one for free Now thinking about a push he thought of a stable there. He's getting the armor upgrade for the stable. I do like that in theory Probably when I see a siege workshop as well as yo rewalls that hole pretty good Yeah, interesting how it looked like velez was going to commit to crossbow siege But now he's out of the stable at home and a stable forward. So I guess my my concerns for velez's two stables Oh, wait, i'm sorry. He canceled the stable in the middle. Okay Yeah, yeah one stables fine then Yeah But I would almost prefer two stables But i'm not sure he can't afford it because of that whole transition to farms as we talked about. Yeah. Yeah That's actually smart from velez He went through the same thought box. It's like yo two stables are sick here. But wait, I can't afford it. So I would I i'm a greedy guy, but I would have loved to see The second farm upgrade since your wood upgrades free Just like get ahead with the farming eco, but I think it's it's probably If that delays crossbow or your knights or your siege workshop or anything, it's probably not a good play Yeah, I would like it if he's just trying to boom with crossbow, which would be a fair approach Don't get me wrong But if you're gonna push definitely just commit to that one here Yeah, we see the maginot not coming out We see one or two knights coming out crossbow and is there botkin in botkin not in just yet There it is. Just click 35 seconds to go He always got eight army six of which he cannot upgrade to elite skirm So it's just like the worst feeling ever and not only can you not defend yourself as easily But you also can't even counter attack with it I mean not that you would counter attack with six scrims in the first place, but it just be stuck Uh, and while normally, you know, you're being stuck in a corner or walled into an arena would make you feel Nice and safe. It is the opposite. I guarantee it Yeah, it's like his position is actually really good If velez didn't have all that hunt to beat this fast with his push because yeah, yeah Like normally did get the castate at similar times going through this uh, this approach But with the deer completely shifted it and i'm pretty sure yo was surprised as well And not only sure what you know, what exactly happened there, but we saw exactly what happened Now we see the maginots pushing in onto the range three range defense and a siege workshop from yo There's you go. Cab watchers here. It looks like it's gonna be cab watchers. What do you think of that one? I I think he needs something that is really gonna work in the long term If he were to try and go archers right now, he's only got two it would it wouldn't work out too well I don't know if it's gonna work And I love the nifty move there to to fake velez like he was gonna go and pick off reinforcements But he's gonna really need to use his siege here if he can use his siege to pick off the crossbows and siege from velez this cab archers can take off the knights but It's not quite as bad as the nomad game earlier, but this is a must-do for yo, otherwise he's dead And the thing is so defenders advantage with maginots is pretty big because You can you can see you can see your opponents maginots. They can't always see yours Yeah, that's a big advantage when it comes to like defending in the situation But keep in mind that velez has a lot of army and he sees the maginot now big shot. Maybe Yo got one and velez misses an opportunity for yo And one what oh, oh he'll get it he'll get it with the ca surely. Oh, yeah Good One for one there. I mean, it's still okay for yo, though And he's gonna go he's gonna go counter attack with his cat. Wow wasting no time. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's sick, man I mean he has blood lines and now suddenly velez is looking at this army And he doesn't think it's good enough and he's clicked elite skirm So he's got three town centers. So his eco is better But clicking elite skirm with remise is one of the worst feelings Dude, it's and it's so bad to scale It's so bad because you're doing nothing with that once the light cap come out. Yep And that's how I that's how I personally choose to think of these games like i'm always trying to think of like, you know the next step the next step and uh It's not good for yo because he's down like you said a lot of economy now But it's definitely the best situation I would have expected to come out from here Yeah, we're in that third range now and atisi on the front here. Did did velez Over or under commit to this it's really hard for me to know because I like the three tcs at home But it feels like it was a big commitment siege workshop Stable all the crossbows all the upgrades for the units and now it's just all withering away You know what it is? He didn't have enough crossbows. I think You need to have like 20 crossbows to the point where yo has to respect you at all times But he just doesn't have that and he never had that so I feel like maybe the knights was a bit too much. I feel like maybe the knights were not not not the right choice Yeah, maybe just crossbow megadel and and just Save some of the food for some of your iko, but I still am very impressed with yo It looked like he would be a big trouble. He responded. He'll get the second town center up He'll get a big shot there as well one for one. Yeah, he'll take it and uh He is forward. So velez has to respect the cab archer presence there And the problem is yeah velez actually had a hole I didn't mention it because I didn't think it would actually matter and he's Walling it up now. So, you know, it doesn't really matter a monster in this in the center tonight Like we we just have to put the relics in the middle It just has to happen every game Well, the thing the thing here is I think he's doing it because knights would be a good option for y'all but Yo, he comes out without any knight support against the elite scurms They still do the bonus damage era and that's one two three four cab archers down If he's got two or three monks to babysit, it might not actually end up being too bad for velez Okay, so at this point what I would say Um Well, I would say the right call here for yo is probably just to go Three tc room wait defend with magnuels and that's just to like have as soon as possible Yeah, he doesn't know redemptions coming in him, but that's a really big game changer because that makes magnuels defense a lot worse Yeah, and and yo is hoping that he can defend with his own siege He's like I can defend with siege and use the cab archers elsewhere But the second redemptions in the monks don't even have sanctity though. So I mean the monks would just die so fast And wow cab archer conversion there And one for one with the mega one. Okay, this is okay for velez for the time being i'm just a little worried about that monk because uh That's the only guy that can really convert siege at the moment And he's got 30 hp. He just gets sneezed on and he dies Yeah, by the way, I was gonna say like this whole like no sanctity thing that's new back in the day You don't show your face with redemption before sanctity. You know what I mean? It's been bothering me so much the last month Like I talked to nilly about it nearly as like this guy had four monks. I'm like get sanctity He's like no i'm like why I don't get it yeah, so it's especially with bermes because the big reason he was able to get redemption is because the The monk texts are 50 off So if you're not making a monk I would be getting it But obviously they've got a million other things to focus on and that's probably the big reason why We're not seeing it right now. Oh my god, dude. Yo is sneaking forward to your workshop. You want to push? That's so crazy And that monk dude, i'm telling you that monk that no sanctity monk is so important here because here comes yo With the siege he could one shot the monk if he sees it's no sanctity, but it gets converted He just respected it because he's he thinks that they're sanctity. You just walk up and shoot him there. Oh, man crazy Oh, god, and now the repairs all the repairs were clutched too, but the monk dude the monk pays the price Yep, someone had to die for that. It was just it was just way too good for beliz But listen, he gets the magma now, not only the zeal does not have it but alphabets has it on the hill Yoshi just abandoned that house. I don't know like why are you repairing it so hard? Well, just give it up There's no repair bill, right? So there's no repair bill and the one is very weak if he can get that Which he doesn't get He shot still from the hills cabbages are taking good damage that one dies got sneezed on as we said Yeah, well done And he oh man, there's more siege on the other side. What's about to happen here? This is insane. Yo's micro. Yo with the plays. Oh my god. He could get four But he lost the cabbages on the top it's not worth no, it's not this is good for beliz At the ville count could change a little bit because of the tc is being attacked by beliz But beliz just adds a monk there. Yep redemption. Well played changer, bro. Yeah Oh and more skurms pop out of the range as well beliz with the swings It was a little rough after his initial push against yo, it didn't work out But it's been looking really good ever since Yeah, we did talk about that three tc that was uh That was the big point of the game here where beliz kind of gave up a little bit momentum early game But now now it's paid off now He's got a 15 village lead and although he doesn't have the greatest leg game restorex. He's definitely very far ahead Forecastle looks like oh my god forecast on the hill would be fantastic right between those two tcs. You see the spot Yep, right and he's got if he's got the monks which to have sanctity now siege isn't a worry for him And yo has had to focus so much on his micro He has never really been able to get the food economy rolling to get a lot of light cav And to get a lot of upgrades. So I think the castle would definitely work out here for beliz Yeah And uh, I want to see whenever you go for a forecast guys go for a lot of those I I almost think that nine is not enough. It's just risky like send like literally 15 Just to make sure you get it up. It's not worth committing halfway to it. Oh my god Did you see that play from yo, he just used the light cav to snipe along crazy That was crazy and he even shot with the magma spurs to make the scrims go back. That was just insane Um beliz is in the middle of the map man. He is flustered Yeah, and he's got 1200 stone. So he's like he's on the fence What he should do here. I think he can at the very least make a defensive castle That's that's my outlook at this point. Just get castle somewhere with something. Um But maybe he's hoping to win a fight soon And after he wins the fight, he'll still continue to go forward with one Surely two forward castles So just get one at home and chill and then look for forward like that makes a lot of sense to me Honestly, and I think that should be the line of action. Uh, not for beliz He's gonna go forward. He wants to forward one first, but it looks at things and he's placing it Oh, no one at home first as you said it nice. Yeah, that's good Yeah, yeah, right after he clears that there's also a lot of gold there. So that makes sense And now he goes for the one on the front but immediately deletes it because light cav arrive It's only three light cap, but the siege will be taken out and yo is going to want to drop one here Oh my god, yo gets it in the same spot. Will it go down? No, it's fine. It's fine I always worry when there's meganos close by yeah God And and say goodbye to your scrims and crossbows if you're velez I mean velez still really extended his lead over the last couple minutes. So he's the heavy favorite to win this game He's about to go in but yo has hung on here. He's not rolled over and died He's still got a chance if this goes really late. I prefer turks You absolutely and I said this in the jordan game that I saw the other day Um, you absolutely go all in castleage if you're in turks position right now Your light cav are good versus even arblest But in this case, there's no arblest So you just go light cav and you go cav archers and you go all in castle to buy yourself time You can't race into imp. I just don't know if yo is gonna think of that right now Well, I guess it's awkward too, right because he knows there's a castle. He's gonna deny this castle This is certainly an invitation to make a little more Just to just to keep the uh, keep any castle pressure or tread pressure away from your castle There's a potential for him to do both like maybe click up and then just continue to spam light cav we haven't actually seen Any extra barracks for velez or at least pike minis actually making more crossbows right now No, man. Why? Why okay, there's like you gotta see I mean, but why make more crossbows like Is this idea to go crossbow to get the position for a forward castle? I think I think that might be it and I think like instinctively He's like i'm heavy skirm and I have upgrades on ranged units. So let's make something that's better against light cap, but turk light cav They oh yo, just yo just attack rounded his own units But yo is like a hill thief like he's He's literally getting every hill velez wants and remember when velez was just sitting in the middle of nothing with 10 bills Literally, that's the difference between winning and losing the game not saying he's gonna lose it But just saying he could have won it with that forward castle now So a lot more complicated and turks can go in balmer cannon too. So if if yo makes a siege workshop He will go instant balmer cannon to snipe any trebuchets velez will go for velez could go bomber cannons as well, but that is Locked behind the chemistry research. So i'm uh Yo should still win this game in my opinion or sorry velez should but i'm really worried that yo is going to be able to make this happen Yeah, so, uh, it's definitely Oh god, what do you even make as bermis here? What do you even make? I would go hell bomber cannon is what I would do and then you have to push these castles But if he makes another crossbow, I might scream. So just ahead Oh Yeah, this is just way too many crossbows on my screen for my my face man Well, he stopped making them. He's made a couple pikes. He also will have two trebs before yo will have one bomber game So that's a start yo is gonna dock. Oh yo is gonna duck and go for oh my god, dude Elite cannon galleon or sorry. Just cannon galleon is an epic play here He's thinking about it. There's another dock where it could be good actually But oh, but this block printing for the monks the monks should be good against the cannon galleon man. That's interesting Wow, that's funny I would like to see him just make the docks. So velez trebs the docks instead of the castle Oh, well, it's too close and he needs to get repair villagers here The concern for yo is the timing and the fact that he doesn't have a lot of stone banked up to repair in the first place I Think with uh, oh siege engineer is a big tech for bermes What you should do right now as the turk player is you defend with bomber cannons? And if you need time you sacrifice hasar just to snipe some siege here. Yeah, um And the hasar gonna be vital against the monks as well So it's going to be how would your monk treb as the push for velez? And it's going to be bomber cannon defense at the time being for yo very interesting game though so far Love the masonry tech here Uh velez also very focused you can tell I think this is a slight over boom 145 villagers. He's like me He's queuing up vills as all this is happening. He might lack top space for army in theory as he loses a treb But he still should take out this castle. I think yo is going to lose this hill And if you don't have the castle the monks can move forward constantly to convert those bomber cannons Do you prioritize the plus two range on the cannons artillery the uni-technical turks you prioritize that here I I would not I would just have full queue of hasar and I'd just be micering. I wouldn't do that But I think it would make sense here No, that makes two of us. I would also have the his arc you yeah Because I think like the angle should be to actually win the fight because you have the better comp right and then Yeah, look at the bomber cannons. They're big shot on the crossbows It's honestly just to clear out space So the hasars and the cavarches can get to the monks and yo pushes right through Yo, it's the school lead yo is gonna take the trebs out. The monks are all gone. We see fervor What is that gonna mean the monks run faster to their death here? Oh my god How has yo done this? And this is exactly the moment he was waiting for yeah, like velez has 147 velez he had the push But he had no units now We're seeing the unique tech and mana for cavalry gives extra damage for the cavalier and the and the light cav against archers Gonna be good against cavarchers But I think the big thing here is the composition is so much more complete for yo-yo forward castle here Maybe a bit ambitious though. Well, he does have cannons and trebs So I I mean we saw yo play some pretty funny castles in this series like that one where he's like losing his main base In game one and he just drops a forward one anyways Yeah, yeah, that was funny. I think like with this castle protecting him Monks can never convert his bomber cannons And then he can always push velez's castle I don't see I mean I have a pretty heavy bias against vermice because I think they're really awkward at this stage But I I don't see how velez can win this game from here Like the problem with vermice is that your units no matter which way you you look Your best units are weaker than turks. Like yeah, you go hassar but like turks have better hassar you go You know scurves are not very good so it's Your options are very limited and you can see that velez doesn't really know what to do here It's very awkward and he is even struggling Yeah, and I think maybe we even saw that before imp era like the castle positions were fine for the trevor, but There was no heavy commitment to one thing in particular Uh, he has a lot of economy, but for yo his economy is actually I think more In line with what he can make also hassar for yo and this random gold. This is a yo thing for you It's in the north of the map where castles going up But velez knows if he loses this castle he loses the game I would I would say that's a heavy mix of velez Maybe not knowing what to do with the sieve Maybe not following through and executing and then also great comeback from yo because it looked disastrous for him He was 30 bills behind His opponent was on the way to imp he pulled the rabbit out of the hat there. That was sick Half to win in castleage he had such a big window and this is it's almost inexcusable at this level of play to Have that forward position that velez had for so long and then not Like really amor through those hills that he had at the front of the base. Yeah He really it's not that he under committed because he committed but he just didn't like get there Like you're just doing nothing. It sounds harsh to say but I would yeah I would like to see I mean easy to say after the fact but there was a point where it was just um a few like haven't cab archers from yo, I feel like Pikeman with your siege just pike siege just flooding in castle and dropping the forward castle completely pushes yo back It it frees up space for yourself to do whatever you want um, but but kind of backing off and going imp and certainly mixing in as many skirmishers and crossbows as you did just Looked quite bad there for velez. That's got to be really frustrating for him right now Yeah, if there's ever a tilting situation in the tournament is when you loot when you're already behind and you lose a game You should have won that's like it's anything a lot of mental fortitude from velez to really come back and clear Just come in clear for the next game. Uh, he still has a chance He needs to win the next four in a row big task, but we've seen it done many times, you know In this tournament, so we'll see yo has lost One game of his last nine played if you think about it because he won the last four In his reverse sweep semifinal And now he's lost he's won four and lost one in the grand final So yo is yo is just playing like a beast right now looking really really strong I think after talking to mr Yo, he was this mystery figure for me for a while because I never really got to speak to him But i've been speaking to him in the past couple years. I know that he's he's very um, laid back kind of guy He doesn't take himself too seriously, you know, yeah, there's no ego on him, which is pretty but he's he's confident, you know He's confident, but there's no ego on him, which is yep. It's it's really refreshing to see Yeah, I think he beat beat viper in something And someone asked him. I don't know if I interviewed him god It's been so many interviews over the years But I think someone asked him like are you the best in the world after like winning a tournament? He goes no No, no, a lot of other players would be like, yeah, I just won a tournament So, you know you tell me, you know, but he's just like no i'm not no And I like that. I think that's um, yeah, it's it's it's not something I can say about myself I'm like, yeah, i'm the best say something bro. You can't beat me, but well yo had his moment. I remember. Um, uh 2v2 world cup Or some some or no, no, no, it was actually like clan masters or some big team game So it was like yo, who's the champion of the world and it wasn't about him. It was about his country He was like s y or like, you know china. That was a cool moment. But uh, that's fake Yeah, you gotta find that man. He was screaming full of passion Love to see it man. There's a land event there. Yeah, it was I think 2015 God, man. Is it's been a lot of a buffalets opens up game five or six. Excuse me needs the victory hara And already has stolen a little pig there. So he uh trying to get an edge early here Yeah, a little pig is opposed to the big boar. Um You gotta make that distinction sometimes yo might take it back though here by the way I I actually really enjoyed this map as well. It's frizzy. Yeah, for those who don't know it's a bit of uh We haven't seen it too much, but there's a lot of um, Marsh around the map, but there's also some water There's some deep sea fish at the back and in the corners kind of thing So docking is definitely very prevalent But in the mid game who knows how much you commit to water and how much you commit to land It's kind of up in the air depends on the situation. But here I see portuguese japanese c90 Looks more like a water potion both players on paper. Yeah, so all i've seen As uh, oh, yo almost runs into the cc and dodges every arrow um all I have seen is Dock and dark gates for both and then barracks archery range. So the only Separation there would be do you go men at arm archers? Which is kind of hard to pull off with the timing or do you just go archers? And then if we're talking these sieves for portuguese anything they spend gold on is cheaper And then japanese have the cheaper lumber camps, which uh veles needs to actually build It's got the cheaper lumber camps and then also has the cheaper mining camps with the strong fish dude, that's It's not a huge deal, but that's that's just you never want to see that Um lost maybe 30 wood from that and that's that's the difference in a dock up, you know I just want to point that out small small things that they add up Yo, yo has been known to delay his docks on these hybrid maps throughout the series actually Which is interesting. Yeah, i wonderful see a forward villager here to like deny the dock. I kind of doubt it The other thing harrah that i've seen be a big talking point Is the hunt? Because you're gonna have most on wooden most of your villagers on wooden gold so you can go water and archers And then the food underneath your tc is gone And so getting a mill up on the hunt is always important And so I think the positioning for both players is pretty good there It's not like it's right in the front of their base. It's kind of off to the side Um I just don't know what time you take the hunt like you take the hunt and you lose water or like you're still on the water You start taking more mid-feudal, but but like I saw a game Where a leftover militia killed that, you know, like that that is a big deal So, uh, i'll be keeping an eye on it and also keeping an eye on yo's villager because I think he might kill the hunt Actually, wow. Yeah going forward just that hunt And we see yo docking on that left hand side velez docking on the right hand side. So they're kind of docking Opposite which is that favors more land play if you think about it if there's ever you know a reason to go land Of course the players don't know that right now and yeah, that's all the deer going down right now Wow now velez did steal quite a few pigs from yo Yo is almost out of his boar underneath his cc. So he's got to actually push that in I think that was some recognition from yo that he's behind and wanted to make sure that velez wouldn't get too far ahead but by the time mid-feudal arrives That is all going to be gone. So that is not an option for velez great thinking there from yo And there is an there's a cost to this though, and it has to be mentioned that the idle time from yo That's maybe you know 30 40 maybe 50 resources that's gone to do the slam So it really is a trade-off with immediate resources that that bill can gather versus that You know long-term resources that you're denying from velez the natural resources there on the on the map So I always like to see these decisions being made in tournaments because it is a trade-off and it's hard to say Whether it's worth it or not. We'll have to wait and see uh to know for sure here Yeah, this is crazy though seven pigs underneath the tc for velez There's not a single one for yo, but he he got lamed hard But then also he has two pigs in the center that he didn't find So I think he's he's down four actually no on the right of his wood line. He's also down two Oh my god, so I think he's down like six or like every single additional pig that he would have needed And that's a big deal he's actually alluring the deer just to get by here I thought maybe he's considering a fast castle, but he was just trying to get by yeah, he does now have it though That's honestly so sick that he could click up After losing all of that and sending the villager forward is really well done from yo I think being behind even a minute here Could possibly kill you on freesia. So Press it's not like a rainbow where you can just play defensively and wall up Like if you're losing you can't defend your fish with walls, right? So yeah the timing on these hybrid maps is just so big. Oh the trap the trap on the scout. No way Yo is locked in right now My goodness like this this best of nine grand final could be shorter Than the semi-final where he had to reverse sweep and go to the final game because of how he's playing this my goodness Really nice position there against the barracks now that scout going down That means that there's no information that belize is getting and he's now going for men arms and we talked about this earlier Men arms without a scout is not the most scary strategy But we are seeing the forward from velas four bills moving forward here. I hate this strategy on this map I think it's I think it's just so risky to do this Is it also? I just lame some pigs and i'm down for one and low on confidence Is that it like is it a low confidence? Maybe but it's also a japanese move though. Like era I also just had like a memory pop into my head Yeah, do you remember that show match against yo like I don't know two years ago It was like 3-0 or 4-0 for yo because he went japanese tower rush on you I don't know if you blocked it out of your mind, but it has worked before it just hit me It just hit me. Yeah, dude, I swear it was might have even been on bubly honestly That's that that's too far back for me to remember. I'm not sure i'll find it. I'll find it Yeah, i'll find it tonight, but that's a good tower. There it is net I think it denies the only lumber camp for yo and he doesn't see it either That's not bad. So in this case whenever you see this tower go up You have to you know, make the decision. Do you counter tower or do you run when it's four bills? You probably have to run here Now we're seeing the blacksmith come down yo is making archers, which is the right response Of course versus the meta arms and he's going to probably abandon this worldwide He's going to do this slowly though notice he pulls only half first true Yeah, yeah, um interesting little detail here too. Is that yo didn't make a fire galley yet? so we have a fire galley on the way for velez and i'm liking the start for velez because We know he's got the food underneath his tc And then he's got the fish that are already pretty tanky with his civilization. So Uh, skip skip the men at arm upgrade, which is fascinating But if you could snag a couple fishing ships on top of all this, I think i'll love it Yeah, so the big thing here is that Velez is kind of pressured on all fronts So he's going for like water and he's also going for the tower rush and he's also going for the men arms But he's not massing a range unit like he doesn't even have a range at home. He does have two docks So that's the big that's a big difference that over time on land yo will be stronger But velez has a chance to win the water here and and just that kind of make the game very messy Yeah, I don't know if in the earlier rounds of resurgence. This was a thing, but I have never seen This I i've seen one dock into a range I've never seen two docks like this So he's going to have to be walled and I guess in theory if he's got enough navy He will stop the archers from passing over but it always feels like that's a little unrealistic It feels like a couple archers are going to make it over there regardless Yeah, yeah If your plan is to control the shore with water, you need a lot of ships and it's just not worth it And I would never want to like rely on that Like I think the big reason why walls are so good is how reliable they are once you get them up You know that you're safe and you at least have that timing where you can react if something comes your way here Yeah, so yo just spotted it. He just saw the second dock and walls I think he must be feeling like okay. This is my time I got to try and do something with these archers There's a tower from velez if you're going to commit to this strat if you're going to do this I like how velez is doing it because he's walling up Towards docks and then he's towering the stone and could it maybe even go for more towers? Yeah, and i'm not seeing yeah, i'm not seeing yo is like really committing to water on one dock and he is portuguese So his his ships are actually stronger on paper. Yeah Um in equal numbers, of course I'm not sure if you add another dock here if you just Commit to more land pressure velez did catch the archers moving forward though Yeah, what do you think about the archers chasing the militia there? I would have preferred to just see the archers run across here instead of waiting around I definitely try to look for some damage because you know, you're on the kind of not a timer But you're not going to be able to find damage forever. The walls will come up So I think you you rush over there if you ask me Well, I guess if you send enough it's going to be okay because yo is going to send villagers and send the archers There's a scout though very sloppy there. Um, but obviously a lot going on at the back of his base It's easy for me to say it. Yeah, village is attacking the fire galley. That's interesting What goes down? Yeah kills the fire galley though. I would say you just you just yolo this yo, just run across And don't tower there dude No, he wants the gold I guess. Yeah, but like no that's a death demo territory. That's hot. Yeah And Fire galleys would hit that too. So, okay, he thinks twice But I think it's been pretty sloppy for yo running into the fire losing the scout This is all due to the pressure from velez But we also have to say the fish are still alive for you somehow against two docks. Yeah That portuguese bonus and like just defending is so good with water in general. Um, when you get that repair down You have to walk across the map But let's just find like he's getting horse collar now. He's in a good position He didn't get you didn't get to make use of the hunt like yo did Um, but he did have the japanese fishing ships and he does have now a fully walled base. So I think he's gonna be okay for the time being so something that you uh He didn't patent that's a strong word But something that you did in recent history with a lot of these hybrid maps Is you kind of let the fishing ships work for you for a time? But you never commit fully on the fish and you switch into the horse collar upgrade Do you like that approach here for velez because he's got a horse collar you probably would prefer he has a few more farms But yeah, yeah choice. I I think like the the whole discussion of switching off of water It just depends on the map. But on the map like this Like look at velez's situation. He has like four fish in the back and then that's it So yeah, definitely and fishing ships are really not an option in pro games with the tempo They're they're more like a win more situation, but you can't rely on them Um, so definitely switching farms at some point is a really good move But right now what i'm thinking is yo might get up to cast leech faster. He's got more food It's creeping up there. He's got more farms even uh, and he's gonna go for a castle drop I think that's the angle that he's gonna take with portuguese here Also, yo's tower veils are repairing his fire ship in the back here, which is hilarious That's so annoying, but he was getting repaired at home and now at velez's base He's also repairing velez is there in the village as well And it's two veils verse one So two veils might actually make the difference plus the archers are gonna focus down the repair bill. Yo, you're an animal What is happening? Oh my god, he's even both alive Let's run back with the villager though. This is crazy. What? He's sacrificing a lot to kill the villager there. Maybe too much. Oh god. Oh god That got really messy really fast But at the same time the fire guys are going down so yo will win the water engagement And trade for all his land army tower behind velez's base will force the counter tower on the wood line Yo, also still keeping his fish alive in the back. He hasn't lost a single fish It's very close and he just towered behind the wood line from velez Yo, it's crazy man. Get it. Get it bro. Unbelievable velez is not having a bad game here How how does yo still have his fish and how is yo on the way to castle h faster? I just realized I didn't know this but portuguese fishing ships have more hp. I didn't know that actually I totally knew that Yeah, no one ever talks about that I definitely knew that yeah, no, I mean you're insane with the game. Oh, yeah sure, bro. That's great. Totally Yeah, and I mean he can definitely hold water and maybe even win water even though he's got fewer water units He's able to make this happen. I'm so like I'm I probably am sounding like a big fanboy already But i'm like trying to hold myself back from being more of a yo fanboy right now. This is just incredible Power behind the wood line now velez breaks the house the counter tower. Did he even see that one? I guess he just barely saw it there. He always rushed that with velez. I think Yeah, yeah, I probably maybe you do a mix of both. I think the counter tower doesn't get any army nearby But you probably want to rush that with those to get it out of the way fast The big thing though is going to be the forecast of t90 like imagine a forward castle Like you get control of the water and then you forecast it right outside his gold like velez's gold That's a huge position that you can fit it Is the position good enough where? You could just go for water upgrades and make a defensive castle because I feel like organ guns And fish boom isn't the worst thing ever. I'm just curious uh I think it's fine to do that, but I don't think that's your style. Yeah. Yeah, I think and I think in a tournament You want to take some risk and I think that taking a risk when in this case That's a good risk to take like your opponent can't stop the castle So you make it hard for your opponent and it's not exactly a game losing play For you these bills man the tower ville's repairing again And he's getting his upgrades I don't know if you caught it, but there was a demo there and yo just immediately starts repairing with these bills Yeah, that was absolutely crazy. This is insane He's forcing velez back in a point where velez should have the defend his advantage and should win the fight Left hand side as well. We have yo with the fire ship now. He's got the upgrade down Um fire galleys actually do really well against fire ships, by the way, but thought I'd point that out Yeah, especially with some repairs good work from velez Pulling back his villagers seem to be heading towards the castle. So he's not helping with repairs there anymore But that tells us he's shifting his focus And he did not place the castle As forward as maybe we would have thought but I like that castle because it allows him to control the the waterway And it secures the gold and right behind that is the gold for velez Yeah, this is more like the defensive castle you were talking about like that's a pretty defensive castle Maybe a little bit in the middle. I don't mind it. Um, I think it does open up that organ gonna push His he's he's winning the game Uh in some ways so it's not about it's not a bad approach at all Yeah, he really tried to snipe fish though. Accredited velez. He hadn't lost any fishing ships My knowledge and oh yo is coming in with a demo in the north. This will be fun I'll say I actually hate the stable choice from velez. Why would you go nice in this case with japanese? Ooh, is yoga to try and demo the ships or is he gonna demo the fish? Should go for the the ships. I think yeah goes for the ship. It just gets one Uh, it's not a big deal fire ships eat through fish and ships by the way These are japanese fish and ships and they're going down like crazy Yeah, those guys are insane Yeah, and I mean velez is scrambling. He knows the castle's up because his dock is getting shot down He now knows he needs to move gold. So he's going to drop the tc Yo has outposts over there. Look at yo's vision for just a second He knows right. So he's probably going to mass some organs and think about the next castle And he is mining stone That's a big tell by the way whenever you see someone still on stone after they got a castle You have to think why is that it's not for talent that it's for another castle, you know, so You don't eat on stone. Um I do like the um, I do like the knight edition considering yo's castle isn't in his base because One or two knights can do a great job at picking off velez Yo does have a monk to get the relic though. I'll be curious to see if he notices the knights there Certainly has the opportunity and yeah instantly reacts. Wow Oh my god, that's the conversion and then he's also already pushing him through to that gold Wow And uh, yo is going for that forward gold like this is super risky Yeah, not sure lotly going for that forward gold after seeing the knights. Yeah Like whatever let me just drop off this relic real quick and that'll help you out again villagers He's out of stone too. He needs to buy a hundred stone for the next castle Which would probably be amazing at home at this point but He's focused on the organ gun micro and i'm just really I'm not seeing a long-term game plan right now for velez I'm a little worried about him if he doesn't kill fish and if he doesn't kill villagers Oh, here he goes hara two knights going in for a monk And good opportunity here that that should be a kill great micro there for velez He could just hit that gold that's on the front right now Would be so good for him Yeah, I think so yo, it's like saving resources, but like fastim should not be on the cards Um, I think he really needs to start spending his resources make more organ guns and really commit to this forward castle Stay in castle age. I don't I don't think you need to rush to fast him But maybe he's is he going for the fast imp? I can't tell Honestly, if you're gonna fast imp sell your stone and buy food or something But but then a second castle would be nice He's actually picking off fishing ships though in the north there. He just killed two or three And there he is buying food Wow, he's he wants to fast it double forward castle, dude. Wow that's Such an aggressive shot like that. That's so like it's almost like risky, but it's so winning like if he just gets it It's so winning Yeah, and also i've i've seen games where players add tcs on this map. There's limited space I don't feel like three tcs works that well because you would need a lot of farms to go up to imp behind that And there there he goes. He's on his way And then we have redemption for velez I think that's actually a good choice here because you kind of have to go for something against the organ guns But it never feels strong to have to go redemption with monks against this unit. Yeah Yeah, I feel like the problem with the redemption is that the organs are not expensive like siege are like they're pretty expensive But it's not quite like a mangano So one for one day with a monk is not like the insane trade that you normally feel when you go redempt with manganos Like that's my take on at least but it is something as you said velez has 25 elite it seems I don't know if it's enough though. I I don't know if it's gonna be enough Yeah, and we know yo is gonna drop a fey tori or two, right? Um, and so that's gonna give him a bit of yiko There's there's lots of debate on you know, if that's good But I think with portuguese with a faster rim, he almost you almost have to do it. And okay big moment here Yo, he's not even sending that many vills, but he is bringing villagers forward He wants to drop a castle right on that gold Can velez stop this he's got a few monks. He's got a knight and he's got one mangano And and this castle is not that forward and I think oh he makes that a little bit more forward I I think I like the other one better. He deleted it. Oh my god Oh my god, dude Mine like not this man not this And that's just that's just a target for any trebs that yo might make if velez is gonna make that one Oh god It almost doesn't solve the problem. He gets pushed off that front gold and he's just gonna get trapped as you said. Yeah And organs are nasty guys. They're really strong as a unit here They don't take any upgrades as well. Like they barely take upgrades So you just make it it's a good unit and you get to invest your resources on other things like fast limp in this case and Yo is getting so much food from like eight farmers by the way. He's not spending a penny of that food. Yeah and I think velez he already has been looking a little helpless because You know the knights and then the monks he's like not sure what to do doesn't have a ton of water He's gonna see imp he obviously knows the score line But when trebs start to come out all of his tcs are gonna go down his castles are gonna go down 78 economy for velez. He can't do anything with it Yeah The funny part is like the strategy is like the fast limp is so scary with the forward castle It wouldn't be nearly as good if there wasn't that forward castle because then you can actually play with units and you can fight it But now there's no one's no chance to snap trebs under a castle and those trebs can reach the castle Both town centers both towers and like all the houses. So it's it's devastating. It really is devastating He always made this look really easy Again reminder in the semifinal He was down three zero and he won four three in the end versus accm if you did not see that set Watch it. The games were awesome and ever since man, he's been looking good And Velez is going to continue to to hang on here. He's hoping he can somehow Pull this back the population's similar hara, but I feel like in like three minutes The population is going to look very different Yeah, and and the big thing is sniping town centers will actually potentially prevent velez from going up to imp true He is clicking it from his main town center and that is literally treble way If you'll want to go for that So that's something to think about in the next few minutes velez has to hold But no bombard cannons. Like what do you do? Monks and then trebs yourself, but you're not gonna have castles. I don't know what to do here from japanese. Honestly Yeah, I i've received a few nasty texts from spirit of the law for saying this but like japanese just feels so useless past 20 minutes for me. Yeah, it's just not having bombard cannons or siege ramp Just leads to so many struggles in these matchups And their early flexibility Yeah, and their early flexibility is what really makes them strong their fish their mining camps their mills, whatever that time has passed Now it is time for portuguese I agree that velez should be repairing this castle to delay the inevitable But I don't know what he's going to make to me. It looks like he's committing more to monk sarah He's got more monasteries in the north But uh monks will convert the monks will convert to organs, which is good. But how do you kill the traps ever? Yeah, literally ever you yeah, it's and and there's a travel in that main town. So I don't think there's enough time For that to go down. But like man, that's kind of scary super close. Yep. Yeah somewhat scary Yeah, I think there's some repairs. He's okay. He's being a little casual about it Yeah, and obviously yo doesn't know that's the impure list you see you guys yeah, yeah, so he'll just take his time yeah, it's more important to take out the castle And you don't need to commit if you start dive bombing tcs And then the opponent has a castle to actually do something It could be really frustrating later on Yeah And so now bomber cannons are coming out from yo Those are actually not the best unit versus the monks in theory But like bro monks the monks alone should not be enough and and the problem with the monks and as you said Pretoria from yo, that's like he loves that actually. Yeah Um Yeah, he's made three of them and I think what you can do as he's getting arquebus Which means his bomber cannons are now affected by ballistics um What you can do with all the food income from the fatorias because you haven't been spending food for a while Is either sell it for more gold or you can make light calf against the monks So it actually kind of works out here every like yo has a plan look at the outputs on the right hara He doesn't need this right now. He has this game one. He's checking everywhere. He is on point Now I this it's such a it's such a good habit to get in It's gonna prevent you from throwing games by doing these little things like outposting taking extra resources Making sure opponent isn't being sneaky and now we're seeing the monks guys while they're good at getting some conversions They're not enough to push back with to here yo from pushing forward And it's simply not enough here yo continues to barge into velez's base and he's taking everything with him Yeah, velez getting his gold upgrade his wood upgrade. I mean I don't see those being moves that can really bring it back for him And while the population is inflated for yo because the fatorias take up 20 pop space He's got way more effective pop anyways Uh, the villagers for velez have nowhere to go. He's gonna have to start making transport ships at this point and then Another castle this is like last game last game of the tournament. Yeah, you don't want to resign but it's It's it's rough, man Yeah, he's trying his best he did convert two knights And he's converting organs, but he still has no way to get the siege Yo could obviously always make more He has a tech switch on the cards too if you were to want to And how is yo losing nomad and winning five one like how is nomad the only map that he loses? That's so it's literally his best map from what I can tell with spanish as well. Yeah Yeah The only game he lost In a while the vills are now rushing Uh velez. Okay, the monks are actually converting a lot more than I expected to be honest. They're sick. They're sick Yeah, the the organ guns are just slowly disappearing So maybe there is a chance Okay backing away good work and now you see yo getting forging so yo is like, okay We gotta we gotta be done with these organs. He's making fatoria number five, man that's insane And by the way, like I always see this argument that people try to math out the fatoria I think that's incorrect. I don't think it's a math. It's a math problem It's a practicality solution like you don't need to put your villagers on resources. You just put down the tutorial It's less efficient than villagers sure, but it's infinite, you know, that that's so good People don't factor that I didn't mean they're crunching the numbers around fatoria oftentimes. Yeah, I think The the only thing about fatoria that bothers me is when players go above four like then I start to worry and right now Yo is going to six That's a lot of space 120 pop space taken up by fatorias and he's got 55 villagers So that's math He's got like 30 pop 40 ish pop 35 to play around with military and that's not a lot He could throw this game if he doesn't have the pop space to finish it look he's about to lose his castle Velez is still in this game I think the big issue is like what? Oh Maybe velez can go in navy and kind of stall it out into some weird navy kind of situation and like control the game that way I don't know angle if you can get the gold for that like i'm looking at What velez is up to velez is going pikeman para if he goes pikeman monk And even just has 30 military of his own and pushes back these castles. He's still alive He's still alive. I think yo should have finished this game by now, but he's lost a lot of organ guns He now doesn't have the pop space What is happening? This is so true. Yo, yo can lose actually. Yeah, yo can actually throw this like he's making back of castles in his base He like he's not even trying to farm either He's he's just trying to oh, he's getting harrisy. That's actually a good choice. Oh harris is big though. Actually, yeah Yeah, harris is pretty big. Oh You should be fine, but his units are all of a sudden really bad because yeah He's gonna be pikes on the field and then monks like that's pretty good. And he's almost pop Like he's almost pop cap. But what he did do is he got all the attack upgrades, which I really like Yeah, and I think there's a chance That he clears up this area before pikemen show up. Here come the like have oh true There's only three pikemen on the field. There's a lot of monks though. Let's see the conversions There's heresy in so the conversions aren't gonna be nearly as powerful by the way big like have and that should be enough. I believe Yeah, and that's gonna mean the monks are gone. The castle does go down It wouldn't be surprised It wouldn't surprise me at all though if yo just makes a new one there And the like have and the organs and the bomber cannon can take all these trebs and velez Great job from him to take out three castles or maybe it was two castles over the last couple minutes But now as the trebs go down, he's got to be feeling blue again. This is uh, Still looking rough Yep Oh my god, those trebs sniped a lot of shit before they went down though Like there's a bomber cannon going down a couple organs Always nice to see that a lot of stone people realize like in theory you could castle up and just wait But look at the resources from yo, like they're flying up. Honestly Would you go cavalier if you're yo As it is the monks Okay, well no that you have heresy now, so they die, right? Ah No, you just go hourglass though, like yeah, it's just a winning move for sure It's just funny because he's only got like 35 pop space to play around with and he's making leg cap Yeah, so it just it just doesn't feel like it's the strongest unit. He's actually thinking about switching in a baby Yeah I think that's actually the best way to play if you're not in a rush like ships Just feel like so oppressive now if you can get gallery and mechanic gallery, that's insane. Yeah, and for velez Uh forgot to check to see if he has any relics. He actually doesn't have a single relic I got two s at his monastery though. I'm not gonna take those. Oh true You know what happened is he tried to eject monks. I bet Oh true. Yeah, he pressed on garrison That's actually I wish they would change that personally like if you press on garrison usually you don't want to do it with the relics But I suppose I understand it and he hasn't realized that yet That's pretty big like you're losing two relics. That's probably like 400 gold that he lost just from that mistake But nothing you could dwell on now Yo with the gallon switch like he's almost playing this as if he he doesn't mind playing another hour today He's so fine. Like now he's he's forcing velez into fast fires when the base is wide open. Yeah, it's funny I definitely think is overkill this many fatorias and we have seen games. I think vinchester was the best example I forget which tournament where over yeah over fatoriaing Uh killed him actually in wonder warriors cup against doubt as well in golden hill he like took the hill And then he also went for five fatorias and doubt killed him with like hussar or something. So my man so like yeah, it does give me a little bit of castor ptsd when I watch this stuff, but Yeah, I don't think I made a fatori in my life. Actually, um, I think I made a couple But it's really not something I play around with too much to know like the sweet spot But I definitely it makes a lot of sense when you tell me like four. That's like 80 pop. Yeah, that's fine 50 bills like that that makes a lot of sense. If you're gonna go for this many fatorias don't have 55 bills Yeah, then then have like 20 bills, but I I think there's a danger to that. Of course It's funny though. It's just low. He always gonna lose this castle, right? He lost one here earlier the stone just continues to trickle so in his mind Losing a castle isn't really that big a deal. He could just build one later It feels like velez is fighting a timer like can he kill the castles before yo can get back the stone and it's just like I don't think velez is killing them fast enough and velez always has to invest stone that he's mining Someone that runs out. Victoria is such an opie concept in my opinion like just infinite resources is crazy Yeah, you have fast fires though for velez and he's on the the galleons and he's gonna clean up all the galleons there for yo And yo, uh Trying his best to still take out this castle We'll maybe need to switch into some fires or demos or something Because the fast fire ships could be awkward and yeah, he just builds another castle here. He's like, whatever who cares And then why is he forcing organ guns? Like yobana has monks just go arbalest if you just go arbalest to ram and your opponent can't do anything like he's really So in his way as far as I know there's like another and there's the gg from velez I think they have like another set to play at some point So like maybe yo is just like trying to dominate him as much as possible before velez finally bends the knee But man, I mean I gotta hand it to yo there were many situations Throughout this uh, this best of nine where yo fell off and fell behind like here hara Balaine was the best example. He lost like five or six sheep Came back home pushed all of his deer ended up shooting down the hunt, which I think was a really big deal for velez Um, somehow got to castle age somehow just made everything look easy I know there were instances in particular the bermis turks one is going to stand out for velez But there were instances where velez get ahead But yo always just made the game look easy like he had a game plan like he knew what he needed to do Yep. Yeah, congratulations. Mr Yo takes the finals five one Uh, I still think velez is the big winner for the tournament. It's not even talk about yet. He gets an invitation To the red bull wololo legacy. I think they're calling it the big red bull tournament coming up in october So that's actually huge for velez. Yeah, grab him for that. Yeah, and and small clarification there The reason yo doesn't get the invites because he well, he already had the invite before being a previous red bull winner So going into this the the highest performer would get an invite Yo was already invited and now velez does get that so beating jordan in his 4-3 Set semi-final was a big deal Speaking of jordan as this is the conclusion of the resurgence. Thanks to him. He's been doing a lot for the game obviously playing the game but also Organized and hosted this and did a really great job at that So I think combining playing and I know you've done in hara playing and casting your own event is really tiring and exhausting Uh, and it takes a little bit more out of you And so the fact that he was able to take velez to the final game yesterday was really sick stuff from him Yeah, yeah, you know congrats to the winners both of them Here shout out to jordan and also shout out to microsoft for hosting this event I really like this event because of the sieve settings. I think it had some really cool things that it showcased and uh Yeah, just being able to see the players just kind of duke it out with you know different maps different civilizations It's been a pleasure to watch I casted a lot of discernment and watched a good amount as well and i've enjoyed it quite a bit So yeah, just really solid term. Overall the resurgence would like to see another edition and down the line for sure Yeah, good stuff, man. And thanks for uh, thanks for messaging me yesterday. Uh, I enjoyed casting with you today Got to joke around a little bit about wing tussars and stuff like that. It's true. Sure Games were right. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's been a pleasure, bro I actually came to the conclusion that casting alone is so much more boring than casting with someone else So yeah, well i'm gonna be yeah looking for some co-casters a lot these days I I guess I guess it depends right? I I enjoy mix of both but I totally understand that so you get like different ideas that come in Uh bounce bounce off of your outlook. It's especially good when you don't agree with your caster all the time like your co-caster uh, which you know, we had some differing opinions here that it's always good because uh as much as uh Casters may sound like they know what they're talking about sometimes It doesn't mean they're right everything depends and it goes all over the place in age. So Yeah, and the last thing i'll say I just feel like a lot of cases is like There's different options, you know, like it's a strategy game There's not really one of correct approaches just having that conversation that happens throughout the game I just find us really healthy. But yo, thanks for uh, thanks for joining me man. It's been a pleasure. Yeah, man And uh, i'll see you around. All right. Yeah, sounds good. We'll take it easy. Yep. See ya Alrighty, so uh as we go back into the game. I want to just show you some of the stats Thank you to everyone who who watched This video and watch the stream and all that good stuff. I appreciate you guys We didn't do the thank yous for you guys because you guys are a given man Anytime there's an event anytime i'm casting you guys seem to show up Uh means a lot that you do that. So thank you. Thank you Uh, what was yo doing with six fatorias, man? Like six fatorias is insane And so, uh, I was a little concerned he's gonna throw that one But also I was like half hoping he was gonna throw that one so we could get one more game Wasn't to be the other worthy champion Good stuff now. I wanted to check how many pigs did he lose? I think he lost five One Two three Four oh vales didn't see those, okay But like okay, so that is actually seven pigs that he has not taken then did he get a single additional pig this entire game That is insane. I don't think he did he might have taken it a bit later But he was down 700 food And he had the knowledge to realize I need to take out his food because he's going to be way ahead and somehow manage that That was ridiculous I think like how yo kept his fish alive and balanced everything in this game was arguably the most impressive thing from the whole series And that's saying something because he played amazing.
