Can you expand on that?\nCertainly. I'll break that down in two ways.\nFirst, when we were first experiencing these objects off the Eastern Seaboard\nin the 2014 to 2015 time period, anyone that had upgraded their radar systems\nwere seeing these objects.\nSo there was a large number of my colleagues that were detecting these objects\noff the Eastern Seaboard.\nThey were further correlating that information with their other onboard sensors,\nand many of them also had their own eyesightings as well of these objects.\nNow, that was our personal firsthand experience at the time.\nSince then, as I've engaged this topic, others have reached out to me\nto share their experiences both on the military side\nas well as the commercial aviation side.\nOn the military aviation side, veterans that have recently got out,\nhave shared their stories and have expressed how the objects we were seeing\nin 2014, 2015 continued all the way to 2019, 2020, and beyond.\nAnd so it became a generational issue for naval aviators on the Eastern Seaboard.\nThis was something we were briefing to new students.\nThis is something that was included in the notice to airmen\nto ensure that there was no accidents.\nAnd now with commercial aviators, they are reaching out\nbecause they're having somewhat similar experiences\nas our military brothers and sisters,\nbut they do not have any reporting system that they can send us to.\nAnd let me just add both to Mr. Fraver as well as Mr. Graves.\nNot having the system for reporting,\nwould you both agree that it's harmful to not just our national security interests\nbut to understand this phenomenon of what's happening with UAPs?\nI think it's actually a travesty that we don't have a system\nto correlate this and actually investigate.\nSo if you took the East Coast, there's coastal radars out there\nthat monitor our air defense identification zone, so about 200 miles.\nThey can track these, so when you see them,\nthey can actually go and pull that data and get maneuvering.\nInstead of just having the airplanes, there's other data sources out there.\nAnd I've talked to other government officials on this.\nSo you need a centrally located repository that these reports go to.\nSo if you just stuck it in DOD,\nyou wouldn't get anything out of the Intelligence Committee\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nPlease summarize the above transcript.

He also talks about the importance of understanding UAPs for national security purposes.\n\nMr. Sean Kirkpatrick then shares his personal experience as a former Navy pilot who encountered a UAP while flying off the coast of Virginia Beach in 2015. He describes the object as being white, oblong, and moving at high speed without any visible means of propulsion.\n\nMr. Ryan Graves, another former Navy pilot, also testifies about his encounter with a UAP near Virginia Beach in 2014. He describes the object as being white, cylindrical, and hovering above the water before rapidly accelerating away.\n\nMr. Danny Accoin, a former Air Force intelligence officer, shares his experience investigating UAP incidents during his time at the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). He emphasizes the need for a centralized repository to collect and analyze data on UAP encounters.\n\nMr. David Fravor, a former Navy fighter pilot, testifies about his famous encounter with a Tic Tac-shaped UAP off the coast of San Diego in 2004. He describes the object as being white, metallic, and displaying advanced maneuverability capabilities.\n\nMr. Luis Elizondo, a former Pentagon official who ran the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), discusses the challenges faced by the program in obtaining funding and resources. He also highlights the importance of maintaining a culture of openness within the military to encourage reporting of UAP encounters.\n\nMr. Ronald Moultrie, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, acknowledges that there is still much work to be done in understanding UAPs and their potential threats to national security.

My last question.\nAnd sometimes, I know you have also said some of these answers in the past,\nbut we're trying to get them on the public record as well,\nwhich is really important.\nMr. Grush, finally, do you believe that our government is in possession of UAPs?\nAbsolutely based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over four years.\nAnd where?\nI know the exact locations, and those locations were provided\nto the Inspector General and some of which to the Intelligence Committees.\nI actually had the people with the firsthand knowledge\nprovide a protected disclosure to the Inspector General.\nThank you.

It seemed to rock a bit, and that's the last I had seen of the video.\nMuch of the data that I would recommend be analyzed would consist of radar data that would provide precise kinematics on the object,\nas well as the fleet of objects that were operating nearby.\nOkay, and follow-up, in regards to the reporting procedures that Mr. Garcia had addressed on as well as Representative Burchet,\nwith the FAA, to your understanding, pilots that are seeing this, commercial airline pilots,\nare they receiving cease-and-desist letters from corporations for coming forward with information in regards to safety for potential airline passengers?\nI have been made privy to conversations with commercial aviators who have received cease-and-desist orders.\nSo the American public should know that corporations are putting their own reputations on the basis, not the line,\nbut ahead of the safety of the American people, and I think would you agree with that statement?\nIt appears so.\nOkay.

It's kind of loud in there.\nYeah, you're not able to actually personally tell within the vehicle.\nI will say the objects that we were seeing, they were spherical, and they were observed up to Mach 2,\nwhich is a very non-aerodynamic shape.\nWhat about G forces? Let's talk about G forces of those vehicles.\nCould a human survive those G forces with known technology today?\nNo.\nNo, not for the acceleration rates that we observed.\nOkay. What about what they look like? How close did you get?\nDid you see a seam or a rivet or a section?\nAnd what I mean is, obviously, the jets you're flying have all those things. Did these objects have those?\nDo you want to go around?\nI didn't have the detail to be able to tell that.\nSo we got within a half mile at Ziktak, which people say that's pretty far, but in airplanes, that's actually relatively close.\nNo, it was perfectly white, smooth, no windows, although when we did take the original FLIR video that is out there,\nwhen you put it on a big screen, it actually had two little objects that came out of the bottom of it.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nPlease summarize the above transcript.

I think ultimately this is going to be a scientific problem.\nAnd not only that, it's also an engineering problem.\nI've been working with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to help them stand up a UAP integration committee to help integrate their engineering prowess into this problem.\nAnd so, yes, very much. I think this is an engineering and scientific problem as much as a national security problem.\nAnd how might Congress help to facilitate partnerships between the scientific community and the UAP focus groups within government?\nWell, I think one of the things they can do is to have these types of hearings to communicate to the public that this is a topic of interest.\nThat there is a pseudo market, if you will, of interested capabilities and talent that want to approach this topic.\nAnd we're seeing that start to grow now.

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez?\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses for coming here today.\nI do concur with the ranking members, as well as several other members here on this committee that this is a committee for whistleblowers and for the protection of whistleblowers as well.\nSo we understand what you're putting on the table here and what you're putting on the line here and we thank you for that.\nMr. Grush, you sat on the unidentified anomalous phenomenon task force created in the 2020 NDAA, correct?\nYes.\nThere have been some things that have been mentioned here during this hearing that I wanted to pick up on.\nMr. Graves, you mentioned specifically during the answers to one of your questions.\nYou named Boeing contractors being engaged in an incident regarding this red cube about a football field wide.\nI was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the interaction or, Mr. Grush, either of you, the interactions between defense contractor companies and any UAP-related programs or activities.\nSo I'll just say that the information about the contractor themselves were provided by a witness and I have no particular detail in that relationship.\nMr. Grush.\nThe kind of general unclassed wave tops, certainly the contractors are the metal benders, so to speak, the ones actually doing specific performance on government contracts.\nAre they required to issue any disclosure regarding UAP sightings or do they engage in any reporting around this?\nIn terms of the contractors?\nYes.\nThey do not.\nOkay.\nNow, when it comes to notification that you had mentioned about IRAP programs, we have seen defense contractors abuse their contracts before through this committee.\nI have seen it personally and I have also seen the notification requirements to Congress abused.\nI am wondering, one of the loopholes that we see in the law is that there is, at least from my vantage point, is that depending on what we're seeing is that there are no actual definitions or requirements for notification.\nAre there, what methods of notification did you observe?\nLike when they say they notified Congress, how did they do that?\nDo you have insight into that?\nFor certain IRAP activities, I can only think of ones conventional in nature.\nSometimes they flow through certain, I would say, SAP programs that have cognizant authority over the Air Force or something.\nAnd those are congressionally reported compartments, but IRAP is literally internal to the contractors.\nSo as long as it's money, either profits, private investment, etc., they can do whatever they want.\nTo put a finer point on it, when there is a requirement for any agency or company to notify Congress, do they contact the chairman of a committee?\nDo they get them on the phone specifically?\nIs this through an email to hypothetically a dead email box?\nA lot of it comes through what they call the PPR, Periodic Program Review Process, if it's a SAP or Controlled Access Program Equity, and then those go to the specific committees, whether it be the SAS, CAC, Hissi.\nThank you.\nI apologize.\nI just, my time is limited.\nMr. Graves, one of your main concerns that the FAA currently does not have an official process to receive reports of UAP from pilots or others, correct?\nCorrect.\nAnd in your experience, what data should the AERO program prioritize for potential collection?\nWe have, you know, location, date, time, but are there other specific characteristics that should be included in these reports?\nCertainly.\nI think that there's two categories that would be important.\nOne would be kinematics and understanding the specifics of how the vehicle or objects are moving.\nAnd the second would be a more zoomed out approach of being able to look at origin and destination after, before the incident, as well as getting a better contextual understanding of how these objects are interacting with each other.\nThank you.\nNow, because I only have a minute left, I apologize.\nWe only have five minutes today.\nBut for the record, if you were me, where would you look?\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nPlease summarize the above transcript.

And so with that being said, you know, the other statement that has been made that was intriguing to me,\nand it's intriguing because my view has been that we are billions of light years away from any other system.\nAnd the concept that an alien species that's technologically advanced enough to travel billions of light years\nand somehow is incompetent enough to not survive Earth or crashes is something that I find a little bit far-fetched.\nAnd with that being said, you have mentioned that there's interdimensional potential.\nCould you expound on that?\nI'll get to answer your first question, and I'm here as a fact witness and expert,\nbut I will give you a theoretical framework at least to work off to kind of espouse crashes.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nPlease summarize the above transcript.
