Hello, everyone.  So Bug Bounty has grown so much in the past years.  Ten years ago, we didn't hear much about Bug Bounties.  Five years ago, it was way more spread.  Today, I guess everyone in the cyber security  knows a lot about Bug Bounties.  In Bug Bounty, there is around more than one million hackers  doing actively hunting on platforms,  such as Hacker One, Bug Road, and new ones coming up.  And so out of this one million, approximately one million people  doing Bug Bounty, only around 5% of the people  actually doing and finding good bugs  and earning good incomes every month.  So what's the difference?  What makes some hackers being great at doing Bug Bounties  and some hackers being less great and finding less bugs?  I think that the main thing and the most important thing  in Bug Bounty is finding the good assets,  finding these hidden gems where you are going to be able to find  these particular vulnerabilities and, like other people say,  some easy wins.  So how do you find those interesting assets  and how do you find those hidden subdomains,  IPs, vhosts, and everything else that might be related  to an organization?  This is all done via reconnaissance.  And this is all done via recon and a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot  of time that you have to spend to be able to find everything  that is hidden.  So to start, a little introduction about me.  I'm Usain Daher, CEO of Webminify.  I have over a decade in cybersecurity field  and precisely in the Bug Bounty field and pen testing field.  I do have a business master's degree,  but we are doing cybersecurity nowadays.  I have over 1,000 vulnerabilities  found altogether on platforms.  Let it be HackerOne, BackRoad, and everything else.  And I have won a couple of awards.  And I have also a Udemy course, which  is called An Advanced Guide to Finding Good Bugs, which  counts around 1,800 students.  So we'll jump right into the subject  and we'll try to answer the questions in the end.  If you have anything, please keep it for the end  and we will try to go through everything.  So the importance of reconnaissance.  Reconnaissance is the first and one  of the Bug Bounty processes.  It involves gathering as much information  as possible about the target to identify potential weaknesses  and entry points.  Is it good?  So reconnaissance is what is going  to determine if your hiking session is  going to be good or not.  The most assets you have for an organization,  the most attack surface you have which  allows you to find some stuff that you might not  be able to find if you have and don't recon  in a good and precise way.  So identifying potential attack surfaces.  Attack surfaces are the very points in a system  where an unauthorized user can try to enter data  or to extract data from.  Identifying these surfaces involves, yeah.  So I've been able to take over FIS one spot in under six  months with perseverance of recon.  When I started hiking, there's some crowds.  Sorry, can you have someone that just take this one?  Thank you.  Sorry for that.  So now I think it's going to be way better.  So when I started hiking on FIS on the back road,  there was around 1,000 vulnerabilities  which were already reported to the company.  And one might say, oops, this is too much crowded.  I'm not going to be able to find any vulnerability  on this specific program.  But once you start doing some good recon, reconnaissance,  and you have some good web application hacking skills,  I think that everything is possible.  And you are going to be able to find some interesting findings.  So how did this happen?  When I started hiking on FIS, I spent around one month  only doing just recon, just trying  to find some very hidden assets and trying  to know more and more about the company  before starting hiking on them actually.  FIS, Fidelity Nationalism, is a large organization.  And their backbone chip program is about everything  they own.  Scope, this gives us this huge attack surface to look at.  But when you have that, most of the time you say,  oops, this scope is too big.  I don't know where to start, what I should do,  how I should approach this specific target.  And so this is where some people just give up and just cancel  hacking on this kind of big scope organization.  The methodologies which I have are very simple.  And this is things that are mostly known.  But the problem is that today and nowadays, people  try to overcomplicate things.  They are going to tell you, OK, you  have to have this specific tool and tens of tools  to try to do recon.  We need an enumeration tools for subdomain enumeration tools  nowadays, as much as there is so much subdomain enumeration  tools nowadays.  So the main thing that you have to know is doing  is subdomain enumerating, V-host identification,  as in mapping, work fuzzing, darking, and other tips  and tricks which might help you combine stuff from here  and here to try to find more and more assets  and on points to hack on.  Subdomain enumeration, we are going  to go very quick on these little things.  And then we will focus mostly on darking for today.  But let's go.  So identifying subdomains will give you a bigger attack  surface, that's for sure.  Look for pre-prod slash environment subdomains.  So subdomains that are not yet deployed on the internet  or maybe something which contains some codes which  the main domains, the production domains, don't have.  And perform recursive brute forcing.  This is very important.  So fuzz.host, if you find some subdomains,  are going to, again, recursive brute force  this specific subdomain.  The good old script, we all know about amass.  We all know about sublister.  But there is this tool which was shared maybe not too long ago,  which is called bbot.  And I have tried this script, this subdomain enumeration  tool.  And it's likely going to find around 25% or 50%  more results than other back bounty tools  to enumerate subdomains.  So this tool has rights.  So if you try on ebay.com, for example, with bbot,  you are going to have 5,000 results.  And other subdomain enumeration scripts,  such as one for all, subfinder, and others,  are going to have way less subdomains found.  So I urge you, if you want, you can try this tool  and try to see the difference with your current tools.  So vhost identification.  Less people dip into vhost.  Most of the time, people will just do subdomains  and start hacking on some organization.  But that's not how it works on very big organization.  When I speak about very big companies, so you have FIS,  you have Yahoo, for example, which also  accepts all kinds of assets they own.  So you can hack on very big scoops.  But most of the time, on these big companies,  what has been a huge success for me  was identifying the vhosts.  Because the vhosts on the right IPs  are going to lead you to a lot of hidden stuff, which  most of the people are not seeing on subdomains  and other things.  So identifying this will give you targets  most people haven't seen yet.  And you have to be able to spot the differences very quick  to be able to know which is a good vhost and what is not.  So for example, in this specific screenshot, what we do  is that I love doing burp street and threader with some IPs.  So I'm just going to get the IPs of some companies.  And then I'm just going one by one  to throw it on burp and threader.  And brute force the host header and try  to find something interesting within the IP.  And most of the time, with the host header,  it's just going to be all the subdomains  that I have discovered from that specific company  against the IP of that specific company  in one of their ICN branches.  So the results that we can see that we have, the first one  is 302 and all the others are 404  so that we know that we have identified  a good vhost around this IP with this specific domain name.  So something some people don't know and haven't yet seen  and tried is that most of the time,  there is some IPs which might not resolve.  You think that it doesn't resolve.  But once you send it to, for example, burp street and threader,  you are going to see connection reset.  So it's not loading.  It's not going to show any error or any 403 message  or anything.  It just says connection reset.  And some people will just think, oh, this IP  is not going to work with me.  However, if you send the right host header,  this IP is going to respond with actually a good message.  So if you ever see connection reset  on some targets, some IPs or some domains,  don't assume that the host is not reachable,  that you can't reach the host.  You can reach the host with the right header  and the right parameters that you have to send it.  This is just some kind of protection  some companies put in place so people can just access some data  without having the right host header authorization to do so.  So when I sent this specific IP to and threader  and I have brute-forced with the right subdomains  on the host header, I can see that some subdomains  on the host header responded with some valid response  and some other timed out.  So the connection reset are the not valid ones.  And the ones upside are the ones which were actually valid.  And this gives us way big attack surface again  because most of the time, some other hackers  are not going to look into this kind of things.  So most people don't know what is happening.  ASN mapping.  What I like doing a lot is on big organizations  again is mapping out the whole ASN of the organization  finding all the IPs that they own.  And from there, we can easily try to reverse and find  some really interesting subdomains.  So for that, I like using bgp.he.net,  which when you send it some organization name,  for example, Facebook here, you are  going to get all the IPs which Facebook owns in its ranges.  And so we can copy all the ranges  from the specific list that we had from bgp.he.net.  We put it inside a text file.  And then we send it to Prips.  Prips, which is print IPs, where you're just  going to print all the IPs that are owned by Facebook.  And once we have all the IPs, we can now  start gathering subdomains for the organization.  So you can gather subdomains for the organization  using subdomain enumeration tools or other things  that you might know of.  But keep the IPs list in one file  and keep the subdomains list in one file.  And once you have both of them, you  can now try to put first IPs and subdomains together.  So what do I mean by that is that you  are going to take every IP and we're  going to take the subdomain word list that you have gathered.  And you are going to put every of that inside the host header  and send it to the IPs of the organization.  And we can do it very quickly by using  fuf, which is a very good tool to fuzzing.  And then you can just do it in one line like this  and wait for the results.  And most of the time, you are going  to find some subdomains which are going  to resolve on some IPs, which might not  be working if you open it from the internet itself directly.  So what I love doing is wait for seeing using fuf.  I love crawling using Katana tool from the,  and also I love such as wayback machine and URL shorteners.  So why do I use fuf to brute force directories of assets  that I have?  Back in the days, we were all using Deer Buster.  And then there was some tool, Deer Search, which came up.  And now there is fuf.  Fuf is a very fast tool in Golang,  which is very customizable.  You can just customize as you want.  You can filter by size, filter by lines.  You can filter by regex.  So it gives you a whole lot of possibilities  to find the valid deers and file names and extensions  over a target.  So using Katana, we can crawl.  So this is very fast.  Also, I think it's in Golang too.  It's very quick.  So you give it a list of links.  And it's going to crawl the whole things  and give you back all the links found inside the things  that you asked it to crawl.  We also use archives, such as Wayback Machine,  to find some links on that specific host too,  which were archived by internet in the past.  And also, most of you know URL shorteners.  So you are going to reverse those  to find the actual links of the company which  were shortened in the past.  So we have to create a custom world list of applications.  So one, we gather all the links you  can find of the target using Katana, GAU, and other.  Two, we're going to save all in one file and sort unique.  So that's what we do here.  We have, for example, use GAUU tool,  which is used to gather all data from Wayback Machine  and Alien Vault, et cetera.  And then we save it inside one file.  And then we're going to run link finder on that specific list.  Link finder, which is a tool that  helps you find some links and some on points  inside JavaScript files.  But you can also run it on HTML files and every kind of file  to try to find some on points and some HTTP links  inside some links.  And so what we do here is that we  are using a parallel tool to launch link finder and instances  of it to find some interesting links using the list  of subdomains that we had.  And so after doing that, link finder  is going to give us back a list of links  and on points that we found.  And so now we have a custom world  list made for the application that we made out  of Katana, link finder, and other sources.  And so finally, sort unique from link finder and calling  and create the world list that you're  going to use on all of the assets of the organization.  So fuse the subdomains IPs of the org with this world list  and keep adding new passes that file and points  you have found to your world list.  Your world list should always be updated.  It's just not one thing that you have one time  and you don't update it any time.  You just use the same world list every time.  Every time you find some interesting on points,  interesting passes, you have to add them to your world list  again and again so that you keep having  some fresh and good things in your world list.  So one of the main topics that I wanted to speak about  is dorking.  So we are going to speak about dorking.  Dorking is something that is really, really overlooked  by most of the hackers doing bug bounties.  You can't know how much dorking is powerful if it's  done in a very good way.  You can't imagine.  You can't imagine.  Most of the people will just go for site  and try to find some on points on that using dorking.  But if you do it well, you are going  to find so much things that you can't imagine about.  So obviously, dorking is not going  to get you vulnerabilities.  But what it's going to do is that it's  going to find for you some very good on points  or maybe some passes that are going  to lead you to finding vulnerabilities  if you dig deeper.  So don't see dorking as a vulnerability finder,  but you have to see it like a bridge.  It just gives you a bridge between the assets  and the vulnerabilities that you are  going to find because it's going to give you some really  interesting things to look into.  So be creative using your dorks.  Have you said sometimes and said, OK, let me create some dorks?  I think most of the people haven't done that.  So if you actually try, you can create some dorks  which are going to be useful for you in the long term  and that you can use every time.  Use multiple search engines.  Some people limit to Google, but you  have to go for Google, Bing, Dork, Yandex, and every Baidu  and every other search engine that you know of.  Don't just stick to one specific search engine,  but try to use everything and create your own dorks.  So dorking, this is some dorks which I have spent time  finding and I have spent time doing,  and I'm giving it to you today.  This is so powerful, less known dorks.  People mostly don't know about.  So if you put some brackets inside the dorks,  you are going to find some results on Google  that you might be not able to find if you  don't put the brackets.  So site separator restricts the search results  to a specific site or domain.  And the brackets with example and asterisks,  the asterisks are wild cards that match any character.  In this case, the dork will match any domain or subdomain  that contains the word example.  So inside the screenshot that we have here,  we have tried this on Dizon, Dizon.  And we can see that the first result is Dizon.gp.  The second one is Dizon.my.  And so the third one is Dizon.shop  with some things on the start.  So just like this, if an org accepts everything they own,  they are mostly likely going to have one word  which is on mostly all of their domain names.  For example, if we go for Yahoo,  you might find Yahoo in every other domains  that they own and they have.  So you can also use, for example, this one,  Atlassian with a bracket and an asterisk at the end.  And this is going to give you also some assets.  Like for example, we have Atlassian.com,  but we have also Atlassian.design.  And you have also Atlassian.net and .io.  And you can also use this specific dark,  which is also going to give you some results.  If you don't use, if you don't put the brackets,  you will get less results or maybe no results at all.  We have also this dark, which leads to a lot, a lot,  a lot of results if used correctly.  So you also know about this one, I think.  This operator restricts the search results.  And so the idea here is that you have to create  your own darks so that you can find some interesting things  on big targets.  When darking, as we said,  we have to use multiple search engines.  We have seen Google now.  Now we are going to explore Bing  and some features people might not know  on Bing most of the time.  Bing, the IP list, we got an IP list  from the ASN in the first slides.  And what we can do with Bing is that we can use Bing  to find all the domains hosted on the web server  using the dark IP and followed by the IP.  And what this is going to do is that, for example,  if we send it this specific IP,  we are going to find some interesting hosts  owned by that company which are on that specific IP.  So just by sending IP with the IP followed on Bing,  you are going to get all the DNS names  that are hosted on that specific IP or vhost if you like.  And sometimes opening directly the subdomains  we found here is going to give connection reset  or not found or it's just not loading.  However, if you send the IP inside the target  and you send back the subdomain we found on Bing  in the host header, then it's magically going to load.  So this is something that you might want to look into  when you have the big list of IPs owned by company.  Go to Bing, use the dark, get back the hosts  that are hosted on that specific IP.  This is also something you can do  using reverse DNS lookup.  But I think that Bing has been very well successful  to do that for me in the past years.  So on Bing you can also use in-body or in-set.  This is going to give you way more and way more also results  than if you just use, for example, site example login  or if you use site example in-stream or in-body login  you are going to get way more results.  You can see here than just for in-body login  on faesglobal.com we found around 4,000 results.  So this is mostly going to give you a way bigger  attack surface that you have to spend time on  to find vulnerabilities.  Tips and tricks, gather all the links of targets  using all techniques discussed.  Send them to a trader and mass test.  So when you have finally a good list of big IPs  and subdomains of an org, now it's time for you to mass test.  You can just, let's say you have 100,000 assets  of that specific company.  You can just open one by one to look inside  the, this is not something that you can't do.  So most of the people, what they will do  is that they will use nuclei tool  to find some quick wins.  But the problem with that is that most people I know  use nuclei nowadays and what you are going to find  is mostly going to end up being duplicate.  What I love doing is that I love visualizing what I have.  So I love using Pubsuit Intruder  and trying my payloads on that.  So for example here what I did is that I'm going to send  this specific payload which is in server site  request forgery payload inside the big list  of subdomains and IPs we have.  And just by sending it, this is some Apache misconfiguration.  I can see that one of them popped up  and I could see SSH protocol being returned  inside the response.  So this is something that is very useful to know.  You can just try sometimes server side request forgery  inside the first line of the request.  So now finally we are going to have a case study  so that we can try to see what we have learned today.  When I started to hack on FIS program,  I found tons of domain names they own  by using reverse whois.  And by doing that, reverse whois using waxy,  we've got around 100,000 domain names  which returns FIS inside their whois information.  So obviously we can't go one by one  and try to test everything.  It would be impossible for me to dark  also on all these domains together manually.  And what I did is that I decided to take the hard way  and coded tool to bypass search engine captures  and rate limits and others so that we can effectively  use darking on the whole list of domains that I have now.  So as it was impossible to go and do it one by one,  we decided to code a tool which is going to do that  for us automatically and give us back all the results.  To do that we have to take care of bypassing captures,  rate limits, so for that we have coded a tool  that works very well.  And after spending a couple of days coding my tool,  I finally came up with a tool to dark on Google,  by do Bing and other search engine that they could go to.  And what this tool expects is just engines  and the dark that you want to run against  the specific search engine.  So my tool would take as input the dark  and the engine is to search on.  So for example here we sent it bash dark.sh,  site FISglobal.com login,  and engines Google and Bing,  and we can see that we got some results back.  So now that we have that and we have a huge list  of domains owned by FIS,  what comes to mind is that we have to launch  the darking tool with a combination of different darks  on that big and huge attack surface that we have.  This way we find so much that is going to be so good  to hack on in the future.  So now we have a dark tool working on the stuff domains.  What next?  Dark with all sites.  So we can use a bash for loop or parallel  or any other things.  For IE in CatList, we run the darking with site,  the website and the term that we are searching for  which is login for example here.  And we are going to find finally around 100,  100, sorry, one million, is it?  No, it's 100,000, 100,000 results.  So instead of just using for example,  site example and login only,  I have done some permutations for example,  site example, sign up,  site example, upload, admin, password request,  password forgot, ASPX, PHP.  So we are rinsing and repeating again and again  on the same list of domains that we have.  And we finally have 100 unique links.  And just like this, we have a ton and a ton and a ton  and a ton and a ton to look into.  So we started with just the domain names  that we had of some orgs.  And now we have like admin panels for parameters.  So we have way more things to look into now.  All the discover links can be again caught in Katana  to discover more and more endpoint spaces.  And then again sent to link finder  and then again back to Katana  and then again to link finder.  It's a once and repeat process.  So you find some links using dorking,  you send it back to Katana  and then you are going now for directory fuzzing,  you find some new passes, some new folders,  some new files, sending again back to Katana  to crawl again and keep doing that again and again  to find endless and infinite options  of new attack surface on some platforms.  And this is this process of rinsing and repeating  and then again and again  is going to bring you so much new subdomains,  so much new domains, so much new endpoints,  so much new login panels, so much new attack surface  that you haven't seen in the past.  So that's what I personally do  every time I go back to my specific targets,  I run some repeat.  So I'm going to crawl again, fuzz again,  crawl again, fuzz again, and keep doing that in a loop  until like I'm tired and I haven't found anything.  Do not forget directory fuzzing on all subpasses.  For example, here inside the link that we had found  from the darking tool here on this specific line,  and then we can brute force every folder,  not just the web root.  So it's not just for example, google.com slash fuzz  and you just fuzz here.  No, if you found some interesting things using darking,  some interesting folders and passes,  you have to take into consideration  to fuzz these specific passes on the end.  So for example, in this sense here,  we have fuzzed the investor slash login  and slash authorization path,  as this is some valid folder on that specific website.  So case study, during mass darking on my target,  the links to this, which says host  documentation slash archive.zip.  Okay, so during mass darking on my target,  I found a link similar to this,  which says documentation branch slash archive.zip.  Upon downloading the archive,  I found some credential inside the file.  So we found the zip file using darking,  we downloaded the zip file,  and then here we have, after decompressing the archive,  we have found a file which contains some username  and password binded inside of it.  So we can see here credentials,  value equal client upload SVC,  and the password which is redacted here.  Great, we have credentials,  but what endpoint to hit with these credentials?  Because even though we have found credentials,  we don't know yet where to use those.  So archive contained an X installer,  and after installing the software on my VPS,  we were left with some DLL files.  And what we can do obviously with the DLL files,  that we can decompile them using some decompiler.  And then after doing that,  and here after saving the source code,  we got from the DLL files,  we finally end up finding some localhost links  binded inside the source code of it,  which says localhost on some ports,  and we have some web service.asmx on point that we found.  And so what to do now,  what to do now is that we're going to take  that specific path,  and we're going to take the whole list of domains  and IPs we have of that specific organization,  and we're going to simply to brute force  to be able to find some entry points  for our credentials that we found with the,  the endpoint.  And luckily we found some sub domains  with the pass we're looking for.  We sent the right parameters it accepts,  it accepted XML content type,  and we sent the credentials which we found inside the file  before the zip file,  and luckily we got back all the data of the company  on that specific endpoint.  So this is the end,  and the takeaways that we have here  is don't be afraid to try new things.  If you have some ideas,  maybe you can think that it won't work,  but if no one is dead when trying.  So you can just try and actually try what you have in mind.  It might work,  maybe it's a new pass for a new research  that some people might not have discovered yet.  So don't be afraid to try new things.  Nothing is sure,  nothing is unsure.  Try what you have in mind and hope for the best.  Spend a lot of time gathering  and tell about the organization,  and hack when you feel like hacking.  Don't obligate yourself to hack,  or you might get not so good results.  Thank you so much for being here,  and I'm happy to be here today with you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello, okay.  Thank you so much for saying about amazing talk today.  So if any of you guys have questions,  so we have eight minutes right now, okay.  Thanks for a nice talk.  I have a question about the methodology of which you described.  As we see, hacking is quite a process.  You need to keep up with all the things which are published.  What would you recommend the person  who don't keep up with this pace,  and maybe can't sometimes feel  that there is an overflow of information,  and I just feel like tired.  What would you recommend to such person?  Maybe switch to management,  or do some business around cyber security,  or maybe find some motivation inside.  What do you say?  So Alexander here is going to have a great talk  on fuzzing later on in the day.  So thank you for the question.  What I do, I personally do,  because I can't speak for everyone,  but I think that I stick to what I love doing.  I love doing docking and this kind of recon,  which is old school things.  Some people nowadays like doing some new tools,  doing some new techniques.  I love sticking to what I love doing.  I really want to enjoy the process.  I don't want to just learn some new things.  No, if I don't enjoy it, I'm not going to do it.  So I just keep stuck to what I enjoy doing,  and it's working very well, you know,  because the old methods are what the new methods  are consisted of.  This is what they get inspired from  to make the new tools and stuff.  So I keep doing what I love,  which is basic recon.  And I try once a week or twice a week  to try to read some new blogs  and some new exploits,  like on the PT Swarm websites,  and also from Asset Note with my friend Shubz,  which publishes a lot of new CVEs  and exploits that they found.  And so that's how I like keeping up to date  with the actual cybersecurity base.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Okay, thank you for your question.  Any others?  Okay.  The brackets in the site doc,  is that a documented feature?  No, it's not.  I've just found it by trying a lot on it.  Right, okay.  And they go after the colon or after the asterisk?  So I can come back to it so you can take a picture.  Oh, I think it's off.  So if we go back to the docs.  Yeah, so.  If anyone wants to take notes of the docs that are here,  I let you know.  In five seconds, it's gone.  Okay, so you were just,  were you sort of like running Intruder  with some characters and stuff to test that out  or was it just completely?  Sorry, can you repeat?  To discover the brackets,  is that your discovery or is that just?  No, no, no, it was just manual, no Intruder.  So I just like, I've had a day off and I said,  okay, so today I'm going to try to find some things  that other people might not have found yet.  So I just kept trying, trying some stuff using darking  and I finally found that this specific thing was working.  It's not documented, but yeah, it's now.  Other ones, if you want to take some notes.  Anyone is taking some notes of that?  Yeah, good.  So this one is, yeah.  Do you have another question?  No?  There's someone in the back, I think.  Someone there?  Okay, someone in the back?  All right.  Yeah.  First of all, thank you for the great talk.  So I have some question.  The first one, you mentioned one case study about Twitter  and you found like secret header  that if you insert that secret header,  the application will return the result  instead of the connection reset.  So I would like to know how do you know that secret header?  Is it a common IP spoofing header?  And I also have another question about your process.  You mentioned that the bug bounty process,  either the repeated process,  after you get access to some information,  you add up into your work list  and repeat the process again and again.  So do you have the method that you store the information  in the way that you can systematically  check the older version  or you just simply store it in a stick file?  Okay, thank you for the question.  Let's take a break question.  So for the IP thing, as we have seen inside the slides,  is that when we sent the IP inside buffer reader,  we got first connection reset.  So if I understand well,  you're asking how I knew that this specific IP  was going to return that.  Yes, so let's go back to.  So anyways, there is a tool, yeah.  So there's a tool called Angry IP Scanner on Windows.  Some other people might use nmap on Linux too,  which is kind of the same,  but I love doing Angry IP Scanner  because I can have on some VPS of mine  and then I can visualize,  I like seeing stuff in front of me.  And so by doing that,  it shows that the domain is online with a host name.  But when you open the IP without the host name,  it's just going to give you back connection reset.  And when you put the right domain name with that IP,  it's then going to give you back  the good results that it should.  So I suggest that you download Angry IP Scanner.  And if you have any questions to try to set it up later,  you can hit me up on Twitter  and I will try to help you with that.  And for the second questions  about how I store the informations of Backbone Sheet programs,  I'm a text file guy,  so I save everything text files inside some directories  that I have made from my target.  So for example, let's say I'm guy on FIS,  it's just going to be inside the FIS folder.  And I have, for example,  14th of May folder, you go inside, you find the data.  And if I want some old data,  I'm just going to put the other folders, other dates.  And that's how I can easily also grab for anything  that I want to see if I need to remember something.  I hope this helps, yes.  A GPT or something.  It's a lot of information, rinse and repeat,  as you mentioned, it sounds like ideal  to put this in a private own GPT  to help you speed up the process.  Is that something you've considered?  Yeah, I think this is something that I should think about,  which is very doable.  I have to run it then offline  because I'm really afraid for anything  to get leaked later on.  Oh yeah, no, that's why I said private GPT,  don't put it out there.  Yeah, we have to do it.  I think if all the hackers put all the work together  and retrain some GPTs,  it's going to be some crazy things to have.  It's a great weapon.  There's someone in the back, yeah.  Thank you for the talk.  Well, would you mind sharing about how can you bypass  the Google and maybe search engine, late limit and capture?  Yeah, so this is a complicated thing.  About the Google things, you have to,  I think this one needs a talk itself  if you have to dig deeper into that.  So to shorten things, we use a lot of proxies,  which is very expensive.  And also you have to code some tools  so that you don't always send the same header.  So for example, the user agent has to change  on every request that you make.  And you have to add some bunch of garbage data  when sending the requests.  So Google knows or doesn't know that you're a bot.  So it's a combination of techniques that I have found  that they have done on several search engines.  So Google has some, Bing has some other things,  Dr. Goh has some other methods  and I've combined all of that together.  Thank you so much.  Would be nice if you have another talk about this.  I hope so, we will see with the team.  First of all, thank you for the great talk.  Welcome.  I would like to ask about the vhost identification,  about the proofhost and the host header.  Does that method work on the Cloudflare protected host?  Oh, so what that, so that we find actual hosts  which are behind the Cloudflare and Akamai WAFs.  So this won't work if you try it on IPs  that are on Cloudflare, it won't work.  But if you get all the IPs of the organization  using the AESN, then you can brute force  and maybe you can get the origin IP  of the thing that you're looking for.  So yeah, so here when we get the whole IP range  owned by a company, from here,  if you brute force everything with the subdomains,  you are likely going to find the origin IP  of the subdomain that you had which was behind Cloudflare.  So that's the main point of these techniques.  Thank you.  Welcome.  Okay.  Okay, thank you for your great talk.  My pleasure.  I have a question about your methodology.  As far as I understand you talking about Katana  and Link Finder and you training in between each other  and send data between each other again and again.  And I'm just curious why you're doing this  because as far as I know, those tools do the same things  and I just want to get the idea.  So can you repeat the last phrase?  I mean, you sending data between Katana and Link Finder.  Yes.  So as far as I know, both tools doing the same things  and what's the idea behind to do this?  Yes, so Link Finder is going to run mostly  on the JavaScript files  and Katana is mostly going to crawl the website.  So what Katana does is that it's going  to follow back the links.  So if there is example.com and there is a login link on that,  it's going to follow the login link  and from there it's going again  to follow all the other links.  However, what Link Finder is going to do  is that when we pipe it some things,  it's going to just give you back the passes.  And inside this passes, there is mostly JavaScript files  which you can pipe again to Link Finder  to find on points which are inside the JavaScript files.  So do you get the idea of what I'm saying?  Yes.  So you can parse JavaScript files using Katana as well.  Okay, so I haven't tried the JavaScript thing on Katana  but I've been sticking with Link Finder for a long time  and it has been working for me.  So that's why I'm keeping it simple  and doing that again and again.  But however, what I love doing again, as we said,  is that when I find some specific passes and directories,  I'm going to directory foos using foof  and then send it back again to Katana and other tools.  So just keep, the main concept is not only  about Katana and Link Finder here,  but it's about the rinse and repeat process  that you have to do.  It's the same process.  Let it be for subdomain enumerations or anything else.  Subdomain enumeration, if you find, for example,  a dev.example.com, a rinse and repeat,  brute force, foos.dev.example.com.  And then again and again and again,  keep doing some permutations until you find  some hidden things that other people don't know about.  All right, guys, you will have an opportunity  to ask some additional questions during the coffee break.  So let's thank Hussein for his great speech  and then we'll be welcoming the next speaker.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Yeah, let's just go for it.  Thank you.  Thank you.

These seven questions changed my life  I'm a firm believer that the greatest discoveries in life come not from finding the right answers  But from asking the right questions, you can tell whether a man is clever by his answers  You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions  Naguib Mahfuz asking the right question at the right time has the power to change the course of your life  You can see the world through a different lens  Scrub away those self-limiting beliefs and eliminate the assumptions that have held you back in the past  For the last 10 or so years  I've been gathering a list of questions that I find particularly interesting  The seven that we're gonna cover in this video are the ones that consistently rise to the top the ones that I find myself  Coming back to time and time again. Let's dive right into it with question one  If I repeated this day for a hundred straight days  Would my life be better or worse? This question is all about creating perspective on your trajectory  We live our lives zoomed way way way in it's just the nature of it  We are the first person player in our own life video game  But as a result, it's hard to see the bigger picture of how your daily actions are actually driving you  Towards what your long-term vision is for your own life  This question helps it forces you to zoom out and see that bigger picture  How would your actions from a typical day be compounding naturally in your life?  If you just took your average day and did it over and over and over again  Would you be closer to where you want to go or further away?  Forcing yourself to actually confront that question in a real and natural way is important  There's a rule in aviation called the one in sixty rule  Which says that a one degree error in heading will cause a plane to miss its target by one mile for every 60 miles flown  The point there is that a small error in heading  Causes a large miss when you talk about a longer period of time or a longer distance  The same is true for your life  If you're slightly off with your daily actions and behaviors and habits  It will cause you to have a huge miss in where you're actually trying to go this question  Forces you to confront that so that's question number one if I repeated this day for a hundred straight days  Would my life be better or worse?  Question number two if someone observed my actions for a week  What would they say my priorities are there are really two sets of priorities in life?  There are the priorities that we say we have and then there are the priorities that our actions show we have  The goal is to have alignment across the two but that's not always the case  Sometimes there is a fundamental dislocation between what we say our priorities are and what our actions show our priorities are  Put yourself in the perspective of a third party observing you for a week  What would that person say your priorities are are they aligned with the things that you would say they are or is there a fundamental?  Dislocation that needs to be addressed the ultimate goal is obviously to have alignment between your intention  What you say your priorities are an action what you're actually doing on a daily basis  So become the unbiased observer and view it through that lens. What do your actions say about your priorities?  How can you make changes to align the two more clearly?  Question number three if I were the main character in a movie right now  What would the audience be screaming at me? We've all been there  You're watching a movie or TV show or reading a book and the main character is veering off course  They're doing something that you just know is going to lead them awry  You want to grab the person and scream don't open that door drive to the airport  Don't let that person leave and fly away forget about that person  They're not all there is to life the bird's-eye view perspective  Gives you the lens where you can look at their life where you can form that perspective of what you need to shake into them  If someone was observing your life on a movie screen, what would they need to shake into you today?  What would they be screaming at you?  What is the obvious thing that somehow you are missing?  Perspective is absolutely everything in life. This question forces you to confront your world from a different perspective  Remember when in doubt zoom out  Question number four  What are the boat anchors in my life as you push for growth in your life?  There will be people  Behaviors and things that pull you back that are inhibiting your forward progress  I call these boat anchors. They literally create a drag on your forward progress  They don't allow you to go full steam ahead in the way that you want to in life  Some classic examples that I've seen in my own life the people that tell you to be realistic  That laugh at your ambitions that tell you to come home that tell you that you can't achieve those things  The tiny actions that you develop slowly over time that are sneakily  Sabotaging your growth the suboptimal environments that you allow to persist for a little bit too long the  Self-limiting beliefs that prevent you from doing what you're truly capable of. It's easy to ignore these boat anchors  Particularly if you're still making forward progress you say it's good enough  You're still moving forward, but these things are slowing you down  You're not actually able to make progress at the rate that you otherwise would  Simply because you haven't cut the line on these boat anchors. What are these boat anchors in your life?  What are the things that are silently?  Sneakily holding you back that are creating a drag on your forward progress and on your life once you identify them  slowly methodically and  Ruthlessly cut the line  Question number five. Am I allowing more information to get in the way of more action?  Harsh truth. There's someone out there less qualified than you living the life you want  achieving the things you want  Simply because they took action and you didn't we live in a golden age of information  You watching this video right now is an example of it information is available at the touch of a button right in front of us  We have access to all the world's information  But that information can become a crutch your entire life will change the moment you stop gathering more  Information and start acting on the information you already have trust me. I've lived it  I spent years gathering more and more information as a thinly veiled  procrastination to hide from my fear of action  Information gathering threatens to make you into a rocking horse always moving but never going anywhere  We need to find a balance between gathering information and taking action on the information that we gather  When in doubt it's safe to assume that you need more action getting your dopamine from information  Gathering is a dangerous drug learn to get your dopamine from action and you'll always be better off  Question number six. What lie have I repeated to myself so many times that it started to feel like the truth  There's a concept in science called the illusory truth effect  It says that we all have a tendency to start to believe false information after consistent  Repeated exposures to it in other words if you are told a lie over and over and over again  You start to believe it's true  You start to believe it's true. It's particularly damning when that lie is a lie. You tell yourself  You have an internal dialogue that runs 24 7  The quality of that internal dialogue determines the quality of your outcomes  If your internal dialogue constantly tells you that you're not enough that you're not doing enough that you're not capable  That you can't do those different things  It will become true  It will become real in your mind because you'll begin to believe those lies that you tell yourself  Observe your internal dialogue more clearly. What lie have you been telling yourself?  Recognize it and then fight back  And last question number seven  If I knew I would die in 10 years, what would I do today?  You've probably seen the shorter version of this question  If today was your last day, what would you do if you were going to die in a year?  What would you do today?  I find all of those  Minimally impactful for the simple reason that they generally involve dramatic change  If I knew I was going to die tomorrow or even in a year from now  I probably wouldn't be filming this video right now  I'd be spending every single moment with my loved ones with my wife with my son with my family my parents  Whatever that's not a particularly useful insight the time horizon that works  10 years 10 years is long enough that you still have a lot of time left  But short enough that it's easily quantifiable  What changes would you make in your life if you knew you wouldn't be around after 2034?  What big thing would you finally pursue? What fears would melt away?  What new fears would appear? What would you remove from your life?  Who would you spend more time with consider each of those questions deeply?  My guess is it'll bring a lot of clarity into your world  There's a beautiful passage from letters to a young poet that I want to read for all of you  Be patient towards all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves  Like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue  Do not now seek the answers  Which cannot be given to you because you would not be able to live them  And the point is to live everything  Live the questions now  Perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it  Live along some distant day into the answer focus on the questions  These seven questions that I just walked through  Live them and the answers you seek will follow in time. That's all for this video  I hope you enjoyed it if you did you'll love some of the other videos on the channel  And as always until next time everybody  Stay curious

Hello, everyone.  So Bug Bounty has grown so much in the past years.  Ten years ago, we didn't hear much about Bug Bounties.  Five years ago, it was way more spread.  Today, I guess everyone in the cyber security  knows a lot about Bug Bounties.  In Bug Bounty, there is around more than one million hackers  doing actively hunting on platforms,  such as Hacker One, Bug Road, and new ones coming up.  And so out of this one million, approximately one million people  doing Bug Bounty, only around 5% of the people  actually doing and finding good bugs  and earning good incomes every month.  So what's the difference?  What makes some hackers being great at doing Bug Bounties  and some hackers being less great and finding less bugs?  I think that the main thing and the most important thing  in Bug Bounty is finding the good assets,  finding these hidden gems where you are going to be able to find  these particular vulnerabilities and, like other people say,  some easy wins.  So how do you find those interesting assets  and how do you find those hidden subdomains,  IPs, vhosts, and everything else that might be related  to an organization?  This is all done via reconnaissance.  And this is all done via recon and a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot  of time that you have to spend to be able to find everything  that is hidden.  So to start, a little introduction about me.  I'm Usain Daher, CEO of Webminify.  I have over a decade in cybersecurity field  and precisely in the Bug Bounty field and pen testing field.  I do have a business master's degree,  but we are doing cybersecurity nowadays.  I have over 1,000 vulnerabilities  found altogether on platforms.  Let it be HackerOne, BackRoad, and everything else.  And I have won a couple of awards.  And I have also a Udemy course, which  is called An Advanced Guide to Finding Good Bugs, which  counts around 1,800 students.  So we'll jump right into the subject  and we'll try to answer the questions in the end.  If you have anything, please keep it for the end  and we will try to go through everything.  So the importance of reconnaissance.  Reconnaissance is the first and one  of the Bug Bounty processes.  It involves gathering as much information  as possible about the target to identify potential weaknesses  and entry points.  Is it good?  So reconnaissance is what is going  to determine if your hiking session is  going to be good or not.  The most assets you have for an organization,  the most attack surface you have which  allows you to find some stuff that you might not  be able to find if you have and don't recon  in a good and precise way.  So identifying potential attack surfaces.  Attack surfaces are the very points in a system  where an unauthorized user can try to enter data  or to extract data from.  Identifying these surfaces involves, yeah.  So I've been able to take over FIS one spot in under six  months with perseverance of recon.  When I started hiking, there's some crowds.  Sorry, can you have someone that just take this one?  Thank you.  Sorry for that.  So now I think it's going to be way better.  So when I started hiking on FIS on the back road,  there was around 1,000 vulnerabilities  which were already reported to the company.  And one might say, oops, this is too much crowded.  I'm not going to be able to find any vulnerability  on this specific program.  But once you start doing some good recon, reconnaissance,  and you have some good web application hacking skills,  I think that everything is possible.  And you are going to be able to find some interesting findings.  So how did this happen?  When I started hiking on FIS, I spent around one month  only doing just recon, just trying  to find some very hidden assets and trying  to know more and more about the company  before starting hiking on them actually.  FIS, Fidelity Nationalism, is a large organization.  And their backbone chip program is about everything  they own.  Scope, this gives us this huge attack surface to look at.  But when you have that, most of the time you say,  oops, this scope is too big.  I don't know where to start, what I should do,  how I should approach this specific target.  And so this is where some people just give up and just cancel  hacking on this kind of big scope organization.  The methodologies which I have are very simple.  And this is things that are mostly known.  But the problem is that today and nowadays, people  try to overcomplicate things.  They are going to tell you, OK, you  have to have this specific tool and tens of tools  to try to do recon.  We need an enumeration tools for subdomain enumeration tools  nowadays, as much as there is so much subdomain enumeration  tools nowadays.  So the main thing that you have to know is doing  is subdomain enumerating, V-host identification,  as in mapping, work fuzzing, darking, and other tips  and tricks which might help you combine stuff from here  and here to try to find more and more assets  and on points to hack on.  Subdomain enumeration, we are going  to go very quick on these little things.  And then we will focus mostly on darking for today.  But let's go.  So identifying subdomains will give you a bigger attack  surface, that's for sure.  Look for pre-prod slash environment subdomains.  So subdomains that are not yet deployed on the internet  or maybe something which contains some codes which  the main domains, the production domains, don't have.  And perform recursive brute forcing.  This is very important.  So fuzz.host, if you find some subdomains,  are going to, again, recursive brute force  this specific subdomain.  The good old script, we all know about amass.  We all know about sublister.  But there is this tool which was shared maybe not too long ago,  which is called bbot.  And I have tried this script, this subdomain enumeration  tool.  And it's likely going to find around 25% or 50%  more results than other back bounty tools  to enumerate subdomains.  So this tool has rights.  So if you try on ebay.com, for example, with bbot,  you are going to have 5,000 results.  And other subdomain enumeration scripts,  such as one for all, subfinder, and others,  are going to have way less subdomains found.  So I urge you, if you want, you can try this tool  and try to see the difference with your current tools.  So vhost identification.  Less people dip into vhost.  Most of the time, people will just do subdomains  and start hacking on some organization.  But that's not how it works on very big organization.  When I speak about very big companies, so you have FIS,  you have Yahoo, for example, which also  accepts all kinds of assets they own.  So you can hack on very big scoops.  But most of the time, on these big companies,  what has been a huge success for me  was identifying the vhosts.  Because the vhosts on the right IPs  are going to lead you to a lot of hidden stuff, which  most of the people are not seeing on subdomains  and other things.  So identifying this will give you targets  most people haven't seen yet.  And you have to be able to spot the differences very quick  to be able to know which is a good vhost and what is not.  So for example, in this specific screenshot, what we do  is that I love doing burp street and threader with some IPs.  So I'm just going to get the IPs of some companies.  And then I'm just going one by one  to throw it on burp and threader.  And brute force the host header and try  to find something interesting within the IP.  And most of the time, with the host header,  it's just going to be all the subdomains  that I have discovered from that specific company  against the IP of that specific company  in one of their ICN branches.  So the results that we can see that we have, the first one  is 302 and all the others are 404  so that we know that we have identified  a good vhost around this IP with this specific domain name.  So something some people don't know and haven't yet seen  and tried is that most of the time,  there is some IPs which might not resolve.  You think that it doesn't resolve.  But once you send it to, for example, burp street and threader,  you are going to see connection reset.  So it's not loading.  It's not going to show any error or any 403 message  or anything.  It just says connection reset.  And some people will just think, oh, this IP  is not going to work with me.  However, if you send the right host header,  this IP is going to respond with actually a good message.  So if you ever see connection reset  on some targets, some IPs or some domains,  don't assume that the host is not reachable,  that you can't reach the host.  You can reach the host with the right header  and the right parameters that you have to send it.  This is just some kind of protection  some companies put in place so people can just access some data  without having the right host header authorization to do so.  So when I sent this specific IP to and threader  and I have brute-forced with the right subdomains  on the host header, I can see that some subdomains  on the host header responded with some valid response  and some other timed out.  So the connection reset are the not valid ones.  And the ones upside are the ones which were actually valid.  And this gives us way big attack surface again  because most of the time, some other hackers  are not going to look into this kind of things.  So most people don't know what is happening.  ASN mapping.  What I like doing a lot is on big organizations  again is mapping out the whole ASN of the organization  finding all the IPs that they own.  And from there, we can easily try to reverse and find  some really interesting subdomains.  So for that, I like using bgp.he.net,  which when you send it some organization name,  for example, Facebook here, you are  going to get all the IPs which Facebook owns in its ranges.  And so we can copy all the ranges  from the specific list that we had from bgp.he.net.  We put it inside a text file.  And then we send it to Prips.  Prips, which is print IPs, where you're just  going to print all the IPs that are owned by Facebook.  And once we have all the IPs, we can now  start gathering subdomains for the organization.  So you can gather subdomains for the organization  using subdomain enumeration tools or other things  that you might know of.  But keep the IPs list in one file  and keep the subdomains list in one file.  And once you have both of them, you  can now try to put first IPs and subdomains together.  So what do I mean by that is that you  are going to take every IP and we're  going to take the subdomain word list that you have gathered.  And you are going to put every of that inside the host header  and send it to the IPs of the organization.  And we can do it very quickly by using  fuf, which is a very good tool to fuzzing.  And then you can just do it in one line like this  and wait for the results.  And most of the time, you are going  to find some subdomains which are going  to resolve on some IPs, which might not  be working if you open it from the internet itself directly.  So what I love doing is wait for seeing using fuf.  I love crawling using Katana tool from the,  and also I love such as wayback machine and URL shorteners.  So why do I use fuf to brute force directories of assets  that I have?  Back in the days, we were all using Deer Buster.  And then there was some tool, Deer Search, which came up.  And now there is fuf.  Fuf is a very fast tool in Golang,  which is very customizable.  You can just customize as you want.  You can filter by size, filter by lines.  You can filter by regex.  So it gives you a whole lot of possibilities  to find the valid deers and file names and extensions  over a target.  So using Katana, we can crawl.  So this is very fast.  Also, I think it's in Golang too.  It's very quick.  So you give it a list of links.  And it's going to crawl the whole things  and give you back all the links found inside the things  that you asked it to crawl.  We also use archives, such as Wayback Machine,  to find some links on that specific host too,  which were archived by internet in the past.  And also, most of you know URL shorteners.  So you are going to reverse those  to find the actual links of the company which  were shortened in the past.  So we have to create a custom world list of applications.  So one, we gather all the links you  can find of the target using Katana, GAU, and other.  Two, we're going to save all in one file and sort unique.  So that's what we do here.  We have, for example, use GAUU tool,  which is used to gather all data from Wayback Machine  and Alien Vault, et cetera.  And then we save it inside one file.  And then we're going to run link finder on that specific list.  Link finder, which is a tool that  helps you find some links and some on points  inside JavaScript files.  But you can also run it on HTML files and every kind of file  to try to find some on points and some HTTP links  inside some links.  And so what we do here is that we  are using a parallel tool to launch link finder and instances  of it to find some interesting links using the list  of subdomains that we had.  And so after doing that, link finder  is going to give us back a list of links  and on points that we found.  And so now we have a custom world  list made for the application that we made out  of Katana, link finder, and other sources.  And so finally, sort unique from link finder and calling  and create the world list that you're  going to use on all of the assets of the organization.  So fuse the subdomains IPs of the org with this world list  and keep adding new passes that file and points  you have found to your world list.  Your world list should always be updated.  It's just not one thing that you have one time  and you don't update it any time.  You just use the same world list every time.  Every time you find some interesting on points,  interesting passes, you have to add them to your world list  again and again so that you keep having  some fresh and good things in your world list.  So one of the main topics that I wanted to speak about  is dorking.  So we are going to speak about dorking.  Dorking is something that is really, really overlooked  by most of the hackers doing bug bounties.  You can't know how much dorking is powerful if it's  done in a very good way.  You can't imagine.  You can't imagine.  Most of the people will just go for site  and try to find some on points on that using dorking.  But if you do it well, you are going  to find so much things that you can't imagine about.  So obviously, dorking is not going  to get you vulnerabilities.  But what it's going to do is that it's  going to find for you some very good on points  or maybe some passes that are going  to lead you to finding vulnerabilities  if you dig deeper.  So don't see dorking as a vulnerability finder,  but you have to see it like a bridge.  It just gives you a bridge between the assets  and the vulnerabilities that you are  going to find because it's going to give you some really  interesting things to look into.  So be creative using your dorks.  Have you said sometimes and said, OK, let me create some dorks?  I think most of the people haven't done that.  So if you actually try, you can create some dorks  which are going to be useful for you in the long term  and that you can use every time.  Use multiple search engines.  Some people limit to Google, but you  have to go for Google, Bing, Dork, Yandex, and every Baidu  and every other search engine that you know of.  Don't just stick to one specific search engine,  but try to use everything and create your own dorks.  So dorking, this is some dorks which I have spent time  finding and I have spent time doing,  and I'm giving it to you today.  This is so powerful, less known dorks.  People mostly don't know about.  So if you put some brackets inside the dorks,  you are going to find some results on Google  that you might be not able to find if you  don't put the brackets.  So site separator restricts the search results  to a specific site or domain.  And the brackets with example and asterisks,  the asterisks are wild cards that match any character.  In this case, the dork will match any domain or subdomain  that contains the word example.  So inside the screenshot that we have here,  we have tried this on Dizon, Dizon.  And we can see that the first result is Dizon.gp.  The second one is Dizon.my.  And so the third one is Dizon.shop  with some things on the start.  So just like this, if an org accepts everything they own,  they are mostly likely going to have one word  which is on mostly all of their domain names.  For example, if we go for Yahoo,  you might find Yahoo in every other domains  that they own and they have.  So you can also use, for example, this one,  Atlassian with a bracket and an asterisk at the end.  And this is going to give you also some assets.  Like for example, we have Atlassian.com,  but we have also Atlassian.design.  And you have also Atlassian.net and .io.  And you can also use this specific dark,  which is also going to give you some results.  If you don't use, if you don't put the brackets,  you will get less results or maybe no results at all.  We have also this dark, which leads to a lot, a lot,  a lot of results if used correctly.  So you also know about this one, I think.  This operator restricts the search results.  And so the idea here is that you have to create  your own darks so that you can find some interesting things  on big targets.  When darking, as we said,  we have to use multiple search engines.  We have seen Google now.  Now we are going to explore Bing  and some features people might not know  on Bing most of the time.  Bing, the IP list, we got an IP list  from the ASN in the first slides.  And what we can do with Bing is that we can use Bing  to find all the domains hosted on the web server  using the dark IP and followed by the IP.  And what this is going to do is that, for example,  if we send it this specific IP,  we are going to find some interesting hosts  owned by that company which are on that specific IP.  So just by sending IP with the IP followed on Bing,  you are going to get all the DNS names  that are hosted on that specific IP or vhost if you like.  And sometimes opening directly the subdomains  we found here is going to give connection reset  or not found or it's just not loading.  However, if you send the IP inside the target  and you send back the subdomain we found on Bing  in the host header, then it's magically going to load.  So this is something that you might want to look into  when you have the big list of IPs owned by company.  Go to Bing, use the dark, get back the hosts  that are hosted on that specific IP.  This is also something you can do  using reverse DNS lookup.  But I think that Bing has been very well successful  to do that for me in the past years.  So on Bing you can also use in-body or in-set.  This is going to give you way more and way more also results  than if you just use, for example, site example login  or if you use site example in-stream or in-body login  you are going to get way more results.  You can see here than just for in-body login  on faesglobal.com we found around 4,000 results.  So this is mostly going to give you a way bigger  attack surface that you have to spend time on  to find vulnerabilities.  Tips and tricks, gather all the links of targets  using all techniques discussed.  Send them to a trader and mass test.  So when you have finally a good list of big IPs  and subdomains of an org, now it's time for you to mass test.  You can just, let's say you have 100,000 assets  of that specific company.  You can just open one by one to look inside  the, this is not something that you can't do.  So most of the people, what they will do  is that they will use nuclei tool  to find some quick wins.  But the problem with that is that most people I know  use nuclei nowadays and what you are going to find  is mostly going to end up being duplicate.  What I love doing is that I love visualizing what I have.  So I love using Pubsuit Intruder  and trying my payloads on that.  So for example here what I did is that I'm going to send  this specific payload which is in server site  request forgery payload inside the big list  of subdomains and IPs we have.  And just by sending it, this is some Apache misconfiguration.  I can see that one of them popped up  and I could see SSH protocol being returned  inside the response.  So this is something that is very useful to know.  You can just try sometimes server side request forgery  inside the first line of the request.  So now finally we are going to have a case study  so that we can try to see what we have learned today.  When I started to hack on FIS program,  I found tons of domain names they own  by using reverse whois.  And by doing that, reverse whois using waxy,  we've got around 100,000 domain names  which returns FIS inside their whois information.  So obviously we can't go one by one  and try to test everything.  It would be impossible for me to dark  also on all these domains together manually.  And what I did is that I decided to take the hard way  and coded tool to bypass search engine captures  and rate limits and others so that we can effectively  use darking on the whole list of domains that I have now.  So as it was impossible to go and do it one by one,  we decided to code a tool which is going to do that  for us automatically and give us back all the results.  To do that we have to take care of bypassing captures,  rate limits, so for that we have coded a tool  that works very well.  And after spending a couple of days coding my tool,  I finally came up with a tool to dark on Google,  by do Bing and other search engine that they could go to.  And what this tool expects is just engines  and the dark that you want to run against  the specific search engine.  So my tool would take as input the dark  and the engine is to search on.  So for example here we sent it bash dark.sh,  site FISglobal.com login,  and engines Google and Bing,  and we can see that we got some results back.  So now that we have that and we have a huge list  of domains owned by FIS,  what comes to mind is that we have to launch  the darking tool with a combination of different darks  on that big and huge attack surface that we have.  This way we find so much that is going to be so good  to hack on in the future.  So now we have a dark tool working on the stuff domains.  What next?  Dark with all sites.  So we can use a bash for loop or parallel  or any other things.  For IE in CatList, we run the darking with site,  the website and the term that we are searching for  which is login for example here.  And we are going to find finally around 100,  100, sorry, one million, is it?  No, it's 100,000, 100,000 results.  So instead of just using for example,  site example and login only,  I have done some permutations for example,  site example, sign up,  site example, upload, admin, password request,  password forgot, ASPX, PHP.  So we are rinsing and repeating again and again  on the same list of domains that we have.  And we finally have 100 unique links.  And just like this, we have a ton and a ton and a ton  and a ton and a ton to look into.  So we started with just the domain names  that we had of some orgs.  And now we have like admin panels for parameters.  So we have way more things to look into now.  All the discover links can be again caught in Katana  to discover more and more endpoint spaces.  And then again sent to link finder  and then again back to Katana  and then again to link finder.  It's a once and repeat process.  So you find some links using dorking,  you send it back to Katana  and then you are going now for directory fuzzing,  you find some new passes, some new folders,  some new files, sending again back to Katana  to crawl again and keep doing that again and again  to find endless and infinite options  of new attack surface on some platforms.  And this is this process of rinsing and repeating  and then again and again  is going to bring you so much new subdomains,  so much new domains, so much new endpoints,  so much new login panels, so much new attack surface  that you haven't seen in the past.  So that's what I personally do  every time I go back to my specific targets,  I run some repeat.  So I'm going to crawl again, fuzz again,  crawl again, fuzz again, and keep doing that in a loop  until like I'm tired and I haven't found anything.  Do not forget directory fuzzing on all subpasses.  For example, here inside the link that we had found  from the darking tool here on this specific line,  and then we can brute force every folder,  not just the web root.  So it's not just for example, google.com slash fuzz  and you just fuzz here.  No, if you found some interesting things using darking,  some interesting folders and passes,  you have to take into consideration  to fuzz these specific passes on the end.  So for example, in this sense here,  we have fuzzed the investor slash login  and slash authorization path,  as this is some valid folder on that specific website.  So case study, during mass darking on my target,  the links to this, which says host  documentation slash archive.zip.  Okay, so during mass darking on my target,  I found a link similar to this,  which says documentation branch slash archive.zip.  Upon downloading the archive,  I found some credential inside the file.  So we found the zip file using darking,  we downloaded the zip file,  and then here we have, after decompressing the archive,  we have found a file which contains some username  and password binded inside of it.  So we can see here credentials,  value equal client upload SVC,  and the password which is redacted here.  Great, we have credentials,  but what endpoint to hit with these credentials?  Because even though we have found credentials,  we don't know yet where to use those.  So archive contained an X installer,  and after installing the software on my VPS,  we were left with some DLL files.  And what we can do obviously with the DLL files,  that we can decompile them using some decompiler.  And then after doing that,  and here after saving the source code,  we got from the DLL files,  we finally end up finding some localhost links  binded inside the source code of it,  which says localhost on some ports,  and we have some web service.asmx on point that we found.  And so what to do now,  what to do now is that we're going to take  that specific path,  and we're going to take the whole list of domains  and IPs we have of that specific organization,  and we're going to simply to brute force  to be able to find some entry points  for our credentials that we found with the,  the endpoint.  And luckily we found some sub domains  with the pass we're looking for.  We sent the right parameters it accepts,  it accepted XML content type,  and we sent the credentials which we found inside the file  before the zip file,  and luckily we got back all the data of the company  on that specific endpoint.  So this is the end,  and the takeaways that we have here  is don't be afraid to try new things.  If you have some ideas,  maybe you can think that it won't work,  but if no one is dead when trying.  So you can just try and actually try what you have in mind.  It might work,  maybe it's a new pass for a new research  that some people might not have discovered yet.  So don't be afraid to try new things.  Nothing is sure,  nothing is unsure.  Try what you have in mind and hope for the best.  Spend a lot of time gathering  and tell about the organization,  and hack when you feel like hacking.  Don't obligate yourself to hack,  or you might get not so good results.  Thank you so much for being here,  and I'm happy to be here today with you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello, okay.  Thank you so much for saying about amazing talk today.  So if any of you guys have questions,  so we have eight minutes right now, okay.  Thanks for a nice talk.  I have a question about the methodology of which you described.  As we see, hacking is quite a process.  You need to keep up with all the things which are published.  What would you recommend the person  who don't keep up with this pace,  and maybe can't sometimes feel  that there is an overflow of information,  and I just feel like tired.  What would you recommend to such person?  Maybe switch to management,  or do some business around cyber security,  or maybe find some motivation inside.  What do you say?  So Alexander here is going to have a great talk  on fuzzing later on in the day.  So thank you for the question.  What I do, I personally do,  because I can't speak for everyone,  but I think that I stick to what I love doing.  I love doing docking and this kind of recon,  which is old school things.  Some people nowadays like doing some new tools,  doing some new techniques.  I love sticking to what I love doing.  I really want to enjoy the process.  I don't want to just learn some new things.  No, if I don't enjoy it, I'm not going to do it.  So I just keep stuck to what I enjoy doing,  and it's working very well, you know,  because the old methods are what the new methods  are consisted of.  This is what they get inspired from  to make the new tools and stuff.  So I keep doing what I love,  which is basic recon.  And I try once a week or twice a week  to try to read some new blogs  and some new exploits,  like on the PT Swarm websites,  and also from Asset Note with my friend Shubz,  which publishes a lot of new CVEs  and exploits that they found.  And so that's how I like keeping up to date  with the actual cybersecurity base.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Okay, thank you for your question.  Any others?  Okay.  The brackets in the site doc,  is that a documented feature?  No, it's not.  I've just found it by trying a lot on it.  Right, okay.  And they go after the colon or after the asterisk?  So I can come back to it so you can take a picture.  Oh, I think it's off.  So if we go back to the docs.  Yeah, so.  If anyone wants to take notes of the docs that are here,  I let you know.  In five seconds, it's gone.  Okay, so you were just,  were you sort of like running Intruder  with some characters and stuff to test that out  or was it just completely?  Sorry, can you repeat?  To discover the brackets,  is that your discovery or is that just?  No, no, no, it was just manual, no Intruder.  So I just like, I've had a day off and I said,  okay, so today I'm going to try to find some things  that other people might not have found yet.  So I just kept trying, trying some stuff using darking  and I finally found that this specific thing was working.  It's not documented, but yeah, it's now.  Other ones, if you want to take some notes.  Anyone is taking some notes of that?  Yeah, good.  So this one is, yeah.  Do you have another question?  No?  There's someone in the back, I think.  Someone there?  Okay, someone in the back?  All right.  Yeah.  First of all, thank you for the great talk.  So I have some question.  The first one, you mentioned one case study about Twitter  and you found like secret header  that if you insert that secret header,  the application will return the result  instead of the connection reset.  So I would like to know how do you know that secret header?  Is it a common IP spoofing header?  And I also have another question about your process.  You mentioned that the bug bounty process,  either the repeated process,  after you get access to some information,  you add up into your work list  and repeat the process again and again.  So do you have the method that you store the information  in the way that you can systematically  check the older version  or you just simply store it in a stick file?  Okay, thank you for the question.  Let's take a break question.  So for the IP thing, as we have seen inside the slides,  is that when we sent the IP inside buffer reader,  we got first connection reset.  So if I understand well,  you're asking how I knew that this specific IP  was going to return that.  Yes, so let's go back to.  So anyways, there is a tool, yeah.  So there's a tool called Angry IP Scanner on Windows.  Some other people might use nmap on Linux too,  which is kind of the same,  but I love doing Angry IP Scanner  because I can have on some VPS of mine  and then I can visualize,  I like seeing stuff in front of me.  And so by doing that,  it shows that the domain is online with a host name.  But when you open the IP without the host name,  it's just going to give you back connection reset.  And when you put the right domain name with that IP,  it's then going to give you back  the good results that it should.  So I suggest that you download Angry IP Scanner.  And if you have any questions to try to set it up later,  you can hit me up on Twitter  and I will try to help you with that.  And for the second questions  about how I store the informations of Backbone Sheet programs,  I'm a text file guy,  so I save everything text files inside some directories  that I have made from my target.  So for example, let's say I'm guy on FIS,  it's just going to be inside the FIS folder.  And I have, for example,  14th of May folder, you go inside, you find the data.  And if I want some old data,  I'm just going to put the other folders, other dates.  And that's how I can easily also grab for anything  that I want to see if I need to remember something.  I hope this helps, yes.  A GPT or something.  It's a lot of information, rinse and repeat,  as you mentioned, it sounds like ideal  to put this in a private own GPT  to help you speed up the process.  Is that something you've considered?  Yeah, I think this is something that I should think about,  which is very doable.  I have to run it then offline  because I'm really afraid for anything  to get leaked later on.  Oh yeah, no, that's why I said private GPT,  don't put it out there.  Yeah, we have to do it.  I think if all the hackers put all the work together  and retrain some GPTs,  it's going to be some crazy things to have.  It's a great weapon.  There's someone in the back, yeah.  Thank you for the talk.  Well, would you mind sharing about how can you bypass  the Google and maybe search engine, late limit and capture?  Yeah, so this is a complicated thing.  About the Google things, you have to,  I think this one needs a talk itself  if you have to dig deeper into that.  So to shorten things, we use a lot of proxies,  which is very expensive.  And also you have to code some tools  so that you don't always send the same header.  So for example, the user agent has to change  on every request that you make.  And you have to add some bunch of garbage data  when sending the requests.  So Google knows or doesn't know that you're a bot.  So it's a combination of techniques that I have found  that they have done on several search engines.  So Google has some, Bing has some other things,  Dr. Goh has some other methods  and I've combined all of that together.  Thank you so much.  Would be nice if you have another talk about this.  I hope so, we will see with the team.  First of all, thank you for the great talk.  Welcome.  I would like to ask about the vhost identification,  about the proofhost and the host header.  Does that method work on the Cloudflare protected host?  Oh, so what that, so that we find actual hosts  which are behind the Cloudflare and Akamai WAFs.  So this won't work if you try it on IPs  that are on Cloudflare, it won't work.  But if you get all the IPs of the organization  using the AESN, then you can brute force  and maybe you can get the origin IP  of the thing that you're looking for.  So yeah, so here when we get the whole IP range  owned by a company, from here,  if you brute force everything with the subdomains,  you are likely going to find the origin IP  of the subdomain that you had which was behind Cloudflare.  So that's the main point of these techniques.  Thank you.  Welcome.  Okay.  Okay, thank you for your great talk.  My pleasure.  I have a question about your methodology.  As far as I understand you talking about Katana  and Link Finder and you training in between each other  and send data between each other again and again.  And I'm just curious why you're doing this  because as far as I know, those tools do the same things  and I just want to get the idea.  So can you repeat the last phrase?  I mean, you sending data between Katana and Link Finder.  Yes.  So as far as I know, both tools doing the same things  and what's the idea behind to do this?  Yes, so Link Finder is going to run mostly  on the JavaScript files  and Katana is mostly going to crawl the website.  So what Katana does is that it's going  to follow back the links.  So if there is example.com and there is a login link on that,  it's going to follow the login link  and from there it's going again  to follow all the other links.  However, what Link Finder is going to do  is that when we pipe it some things,  it's going to just give you back the passes.  And inside this passes, there is mostly JavaScript files  which you can pipe again to Link Finder  to find on points which are inside the JavaScript files.  So do you get the idea of what I'm saying?  Yes.  So you can parse JavaScript files using Katana as well.  Okay, so I haven't tried the JavaScript thing on Katana  but I've been sticking with Link Finder for a long time  and it has been working for me.  So that's why I'm keeping it simple  and doing that again and again.  But however, what I love doing again, as we said,  is that when I find some specific passes and directories,  I'm going to directory foos using foof  and then send it back again to Katana and other tools.  So just keep, the main concept is not only  about Katana and Link Finder here,  but it's about the rinse and repeat process  that you have to do.  It's the same process.  Let it be for subdomain enumerations or anything else.  Subdomain enumeration, if you find, for example,  a dev.example.com, a rinse and repeat,  brute force, foos.dev.example.com.  And then again and again and again,  keep doing some permutations until you find  some hidden things that other people don't know about.  All right, guys, you will have an opportunity  to ask some additional questions during the coffee break.  So let's thank Hussein for his great speech  and then we'll be welcoming the next speaker.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Yeah, let's just go for it.  Thank you.  Thank you.

These seven questions changed my life  I'm a firm believer that the greatest discoveries in life come not from finding the right answers  But from asking the right questions, you can tell whether a man is clever by his answers  You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions  Naguib Mahfuz asking the right question at the right time has the power to change the course of your life  You can see the world through a different lens  Scrub away those self-limiting beliefs and eliminate the assumptions that have held you back in the past  For the last 10 or so years  I've been gathering a list of questions that I find particularly interesting  The seven that we're gonna cover in this video are the ones that consistently rise to the top the ones that I find myself  Coming back to time and time again. Let's dive right into it with question one  If I repeated this day for a hundred straight days  Would my life be better or worse? This question is all about creating perspective on your trajectory  We live our lives zoomed way way way in it's just the nature of it  We are the first person player in our own life video game  But as a result, it's hard to see the bigger picture of how your daily actions are actually driving you  Towards what your long-term vision is for your own life  This question helps it forces you to zoom out and see that bigger picture  How would your actions from a typical day be compounding naturally in your life?  If you just took your average day and did it over and over and over again  Would you be closer to where you want to go or further away?  Forcing yourself to actually confront that question in a real and natural way is important  There's a rule in aviation called the one in sixty rule  Which says that a one degree error in heading will cause a plane to miss its target by one mile for every 60 miles flown  The point there is that a small error in heading  Causes a large miss when you talk about a longer period of time or a longer distance  The same is true for your life  If you're slightly off with your daily actions and behaviors and habits  It will cause you to have a huge miss in where you're actually trying to go this question  Forces you to confront that so that's question number one if I repeated this day for a hundred straight days  Would my life be better or worse?  Question number two if someone observed my actions for a week  What would they say my priorities are there are really two sets of priorities in life?  There are the priorities that we say we have and then there are the priorities that our actions show we have  The goal is to have alignment across the two but that's not always the case  Sometimes there is a fundamental dislocation between what we say our priorities are and what our actions show our priorities are  Put yourself in the perspective of a third party observing you for a week  What would that person say your priorities are are they aligned with the things that you would say they are or is there a fundamental?  Dislocation that needs to be addressed the ultimate goal is obviously to have alignment between your intention  What you say your priorities are an action what you're actually doing on a daily basis  So become the unbiased observer and view it through that lens. What do your actions say about your priorities?  How can you make changes to align the two more clearly?  Question number three if I were the main character in a movie right now  What would the audience be screaming at me? We've all been there  You're watching a movie or TV show or reading a book and the main character is veering off course  They're doing something that you just know is going to lead them awry  You want to grab the person and scream don't open that door drive to the airport  Don't let that person leave and fly away forget about that person  They're not all there is to life the bird's-eye view perspective  Gives you the lens where you can look at their life where you can form that perspective of what you need to shake into them  If someone was observing your life on a movie screen, what would they need to shake into you today?  What would they be screaming at you?  What is the obvious thing that somehow you are missing?  Perspective is absolutely everything in life. This question forces you to confront your world from a different perspective  Remember when in doubt zoom out  Question number four  What are the boat anchors in my life as you push for growth in your life?  There will be people  Behaviors and things that pull you back that are inhibiting your forward progress  I call these boat anchors. They literally create a drag on your forward progress  They don't allow you to go full steam ahead in the way that you want to in life  Some classic examples that I've seen in my own life the people that tell you to be realistic  That laugh at your ambitions that tell you to come home that tell you that you can't achieve those things  The tiny actions that you develop slowly over time that are sneakily  Sabotaging your growth the suboptimal environments that you allow to persist for a little bit too long the  Self-limiting beliefs that prevent you from doing what you're truly capable of. It's easy to ignore these boat anchors  Particularly if you're still making forward progress you say it's good enough  You're still moving forward, but these things are slowing you down  You're not actually able to make progress at the rate that you otherwise would  Simply because you haven't cut the line on these boat anchors. What are these boat anchors in your life?  What are the things that are silently?  Sneakily holding you back that are creating a drag on your forward progress and on your life once you identify them  slowly methodically and  Ruthlessly cut the line  Question number five. Am I allowing more information to get in the way of more action?  Harsh truth. There's someone out there less qualified than you living the life you want  achieving the things you want  Simply because they took action and you didn't we live in a golden age of information  You watching this video right now is an example of it information is available at the touch of a button right in front of us  We have access to all the world's information  But that information can become a crutch your entire life will change the moment you stop gathering more  Information and start acting on the information you already have trust me. I've lived it  I spent years gathering more and more information as a thinly veiled  procrastination to hide from my fear of action  Information gathering threatens to make you into a rocking horse always moving but never going anywhere  We need to find a balance between gathering information and taking action on the information that we gather  When in doubt it's safe to assume that you need more action getting your dopamine from information  Gathering is a dangerous drug learn to get your dopamine from action and you'll always be better off  Question number six. What lie have I repeated to myself so many times that it started to feel like the truth  There's a concept in science called the illusory truth effect  It says that we all have a tendency to start to believe false information after consistent  Repeated exposures to it in other words if you are told a lie over and over and over again  You start to believe it's true  You start to believe it's true. It's particularly damning when that lie is a lie. You tell yourself  You have an internal dialogue that runs 24 7  The quality of that internal dialogue determines the quality of your outcomes  If your internal dialogue constantly tells you that you're not enough that you're not doing enough that you're not capable  That you can't do those different things  It will become true  It will become real in your mind because you'll begin to believe those lies that you tell yourself  Observe your internal dialogue more clearly. What lie have you been telling yourself?  Recognize it and then fight back  And last question number seven  If I knew I would die in 10 years, what would I do today?  You've probably seen the shorter version of this question  If today was your last day, what would you do if you were going to die in a year?  What would you do today?  I find all of those  Minimally impactful for the simple reason that they generally involve dramatic change  If I knew I was going to die tomorrow or even in a year from now  I probably wouldn't be filming this video right now  I'd be spending every single moment with my loved ones with my wife with my son with my family my parents  Whatever that's not a particularly useful insight the time horizon that works  10 years 10 years is long enough that you still have a lot of time left  But short enough that it's easily quantifiable  What changes would you make in your life if you knew you wouldn't be around after 2034?  What big thing would you finally pursue? What fears would melt away?  What new fears would appear? What would you remove from your life?  Who would you spend more time with consider each of those questions deeply?  My guess is it'll bring a lot of clarity into your world  There's a beautiful passage from letters to a young poet that I want to read for all of you  Be patient towards all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves  Like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue  Do not now seek the answers  Which cannot be given to you because you would not be able to live them  And the point is to live everything  Live the questions now  Perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it  Live along some distant day into the answer focus on the questions  These seven questions that I just walked through  Live them and the answers you seek will follow in time. That's all for this video  I hope you enjoyed it if you did you'll love some of the other videos on the channel  And as always until next time everybody  Stay curious
